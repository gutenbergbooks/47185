<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The facts observed and recorded by others
assisted me to advance so far on the trodden
path that I made an effort to snatch a secret
from Nature.</p>

<p>What I succeeded in obtaining, though
small, induced me to set forth in the following
pages the perhaps not unimportant results.</p>

<p>The labor was long, and engaged my attention
for years. And yet, amidst my continuous
labors in the province of Embryology,
it remained all the time a matter of secondary
importance, my principal attention being
engaged by far more extensive studies.</p>

<p>My desire is to stimulate others to wider
observation. May the facts which I here discuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
prove of utility, and encourage further
studies in this direction with the assistance
of modern science.</p>

<p>If we are not in a position to control the
processes of Nature, we can nevertheless
exercise over them a more or less effective
influence, so as to obtain such results as are
possible.</p>

<p>Whatsoever the question may be that we
propose to discuss, it is sometimes very difficult
to reach any answer. And yet, when experience
and diligence have helped us over the
difficulties, we succeed at last in reaching the
answer desired. The difficulties assume much
less formidable shapes when an individual is
satisfied with shaking his head and regarding
the whole affair with mistrust. In that way
the inexperienced and lazy are at once able
to launch their views without further trouble.
They believe or they disbelieve; and they
like to have their say. Any one can in this
way easily win himself a place amongst those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
who have written on a topic. The man who
desires to obtain a lasting place takes on his
shoulders heavier responsibilities.</p>

<p>This book contains but a portion of the
vast and wide-reaching literature dealing with
the subject in hand. That literature extends
back to the date of man’s earliest intellectual
labors. The observations that have been recorded
by others are here followed by methods
of investigation, and by considerations
which may serve to elucidate the facts. In
conclusion, a section has been dedicated to
the methods which I recommend for the artificial
influencing of sex. Some particular
experiments are subjoined.</p>

<p>May my little book, then, go out into the
world and make known my views, which are
founded exclusively upon facts.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p>In sexually differentiated individuals, the
difference of sex is already apparent in the
embryonal state of existence, not only in the
exterior form, but also in the interior cellular
rudiments which subsequently form the genital
organs. In both, the earliest forms are of
such a nature that, up to a certain period, it
is impossible for investigations conducted with
the means at present at our disposal to discover
any distinction. Soon, however, after
this, in such organisms as have a distinction
of sex, elementary male and female forms of
the organs of reproduction can be recognized
developing themselves in the embryo out of
the substratum of formative elements. Some
of these remain in a rudimentary condition;
others attain to complete development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>These processes take place at a relatively
early period. They do not seem to make
their first appearance, as phenomena of vitality,
in the course of the life-development of
the cells of the ovum. But it is not improbable
that, from the very outset, the ovule has a
capacity to transfer (during the process of segmentation)
to a corresponding cell-substance
(out of which the generative organs will be
subsequently developed) the force contained
in the ovule, so that the cell-substance may
afterwards take up the office of providing for
the preservation of the species. The cells of
the ovum derive this power from the protoplasma
of the ovum, and retain it in a rudimentary
form for one sex, whilst for the
other they possess it in full measure. This
energy is contained in the ovule itself in an
unknown condition. In it lies the basis of the
formation and development of the future sex.
In close connection with this property of the
ovule, lies another faculty, included in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ovule, namely, that the other different elements
proceeding from the cell-body of the
ovum, starting from the protoplasma of the
ovum, are endowed with certain vital peculiarities,
according as they belong to the future
male, or female, organisms.</p>

<p>It will be plain from this that the germ of
the future sex must be sought in the first cell-segmentation
of an ovum. As soon as some
of the cells derived from the primary protoplasm
of the ovum have developed themselves
into genital cells, the other elements
which have originated from the same ovum
are in such a manner conditioned that, in the
latter stages of their vitality, they adapt themselves,
and, in short, adapt the properties inherent
in all the cells, to the sex of the
individual. According, as the ovum is male
or female, so are also the cells which originate
from it either all male or all female.</p>

<p>It will be seen that not only do different
cells for the different sexes develop themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
out of an ovum, but that also, at the
same time with these, a peculiarity reveals
itself in the other cells, in accordance with
which the sexually different organisms exhibit
a difference in their vital capacities, and take
also different forms. The distinction between
male and female characteristics appears to
be determined before the fecundation of the
ovum. The formation of the ova in the
ovary, and their further development, seem,
however, not to be independent of external
influences. It is possible that upon these circumstances
depend the number of ova contained
in the ovary. But, apart from the
question of quantity, it is possible that many
characteristics might so affect the quality of
the ovum, as to exercise an influence over its
capacity for fecundation. We may here mention
an experiment which was made with the
ova of a rabbit, from which it was quite clear
that the capacity of an ovum for fecundation
was immediately diminished when the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
elements attached to the ovule, in
consequence of the density of their investing
substance, offered a resistance to penetration
by the spermatozoa. (Schenk.) The penetration
of a spermatozoon into the protoplasm
of the ovum becomes possible only when, in
consequence of the movements of the spermatozoon,
the cells of the surface of the ovum
can be thrust aside. This is facilitated when
the investing substance is considerably relaxed,
as is the case when the ovum is ripe.
Other circumstances, also, which can in some
cases be easily detected, may prove detrimental
to fecundation and development. Indeed,
they can even exercise an influence
over the sex which is to be developed out of
the ovum. Bee-masters (F. Gerstung) have
frequently shown that the food exercises a
striking influence upon the formation of sex
in the ova. (v. Berlepsch.)</p>

<p>All evidence goes to support the view that
such external influences as would favorably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
affect the separate sexual individual might
also promote the production of one sex or
the other. In Hensen’s valuable work on
generation, a number of instances are adduced,
gathered from various authors, which
make it clear that the nutrition of the parents,
apart from any question of race, is capable
of exercising an influence upon the sex
of the children. (Ploss.) In plants which
produce separate male and female blossoms
(Lenkhart), the male blossoms are more numerous
when the temperature is relatively
high, whilst in shaded places and damp soils
a greater number of female individuals will
be observed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Facts which might assist to explain the
origin of sex have been sought after from
very early times, and have been also placed
in very different lights. The result on every
occasion, when this subject has been discussed,
has been always a wide difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
opinion. People have, in consequence, been
induced to fall back upon theories of different
sorts, theories which have for varying
periods, sometimes long, sometimes short,
been accepted as of some assistance towards
a scientific explanation. In all the theories
which have been propounded, the sex has
been regarded as already determined in the
ovum, or else the origin of the sex has been
assigned to some early stage of the development.</p>

<p>The earliest statements extend back into
the ages of myth and fable, in consequence
of which any exact comparison of them is
not an easy task. All the different manuals
which deal with the present question touch
upon these early views, and for this reason
I am unwilling entirely to ignore them here.
I shall, accordingly, select a few of the more
important for mention.</p>

<p>The reproductive glands of the two sexes
were supposed to contain generative matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
distributed in such a way, on the right and
left, that the right ovary and the right testicle
contained the generative secretions for
the production of the males, and the left
ovary and left testicle those which produced
females. It is immediately evident
that, according to this theory, it was impossible
to exercise any influence over the sex
of the future individual. This primitive theory
is ever cropping up anew, always to be
again rejected. Of various other theories of
the same kind, only those deserve any attention
which rest upon some basis of fact. Accordingly,
recourse has been had to statistics,
and an attempt has been made to reach, from
the figures which they furnish, some certainty
respecting which sex was the more numerous,
and what should be concluded to be the
cause of the greater prevalence of the one
sex or the other. The fact was, however,
apparently overlooked that the available statistics,
though in many respects of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
scientific value, could be of real significance
only when the numbers were gathered from
widely distributed peoples amongst whom
there was none of that wandering about the
world which characterizes modern society.</p>

<p>I am at the same time unwilling to omit
data, resting upon numbers which have been
gathered from statistics, and are not without
value for the determination of many important
questions.</p>

<p>Ploss has in this way shown that in favorable
years, when food was cheap, the births
showed an excess of girls. Under unfavorable
circumstances, more male individuals were
born.</p>

<p>A comparison of statistics, however, soon
led to another theory, which culminated in
this result, that in all countries an excess of
male individuals was born.</p>

<p>To what extent this relation between the
numbers of the sexes can be maintained, and
may serve for a fixed rule, is at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
time a question to be regarded with caution.
An unimpeachable result of such investigations
is rendered more unlikely by the
fact that comparisons of numbers lead to
a conclusion of an exactly contrary nature,
making the feminine sex the more numerous.
These facts at once suggest that we
are not dealing with fixed or normally recurring
numerical proportions, which would repeat
themselves at each numeration. And it
is also possible that external influences may
in various ways affect such numerical proportions.</p>

<p>We may add also that, in investigations of
this kind, other circumstances should be taken
into consideration. Thus, in the case of endemic
or epidemic disease, the births which
furnish the statistics fluctuate, and the stability
of the numbers, in consequence, is modified
by these exceptional occurrences.</p>

<p>The numbers (Oesterlen) which are based
upon the population of half Europe, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
amongst the widest of statistical data, and
furnish information of the highest value.</p>

<p>They represent 59,350,000 births. These
showed an excess of male births. The proportions
were 106.3 boys to 100 girls. Of
course, these numbers refer to the new-born,
and must necessarily be very much altered
by the age of puberty. In fact, the powerful
influences which come into play in the life
after birth would very considerably affect the
former of the above numbers. This is, however,
a matter for further statistical investigation,
and of little importance in our present
inquiry. The numbers (Oesterlen) are in
this respect very remarkable: the average of
the total number of births in the various
states corresponds very nearly with the numbers
in the several states, or at least shows
no difference worthy of consideration. In the
single states, the proportion of boys to 100
girls varied from 105.2 to 107.2. Thus the
proportion of the number of male individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
born to the number of females very nearly
corresponded with the proportion shown by
the total of all countries enumerated. Statistics
derived from the genealogies of Court
calendars gave (according to Kisch) 107.7 boys
to 100 girls.</p>

<p>I am prompted here to quote also the statistical
numbers given in Hensen’s work,
which have been taken from Darwin’s ‘Descent
of Man.’ Of pigs, rabbits, and pigeons,
more males are born than females. For
every 100 mares, 99.4 horses are born. In
the case of greyhounds, 110 dogs are born
for every 100 bitches. Of horned cattle 94.4
males, of poultry 94.7 males are born for
every 100 females. The degree of accuracy
and the limits of error which here remain undefined,
make fluctuations easily perceptible.
The mistakes, also, which may be made in
such cases, are not always the same.</p>

<p>Statistics have been in many other ways
called in to assist in the discussion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
question before us. In the early decades of
the present century a question was raised—what
was the effect upon the relative number
of births of male or female individuals
when the parents were of like or unlike
ages?</p>

<p>Hofacker, in the year 1828, and Sadler (an
Englishman), in the year 1830, attempted to
solve this problem, and found adherents for
their theories based upon numerical returns.
But the Frenchman, Girou (Paris, 1838), appeared
as an opponent of their views, also
supporting his opinions by numbers obtained
in the same manner, probably, as those of
Hofacker and Sadler.</p>

<p>I shall not here reproduce the tables which
were constructed for the discussion of this
question. Any one who occupies himself
with these questions can refer to the respective
technical works, and I shall content
myself with mentioning some of the results.
If the man is older than the woman, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
boys will be born. According to Sadler, the
statistics showed even 121.4 boys for 100 girls.</p>

<p>If both the parents are of the same age,
fewer boys than girls will be born. According
to Sadler, in this case for every 100 girls
only 94.8 boys are born. But if the woman is
older than the man, an excess of girls in the
family is the result. According to the two
above-mentioned authors, when the mother is
older than the father the proportions are:
86.5 boys to 100 girls.</p>

<p>Similar numbers collected by other specialists
differ not inconsiderably from those given
by Sadler. Regarding the proportions of
male and female births as affected by the
respective ages of the parents, Sadler’s
numbers show the widest differences of all.
Breslau and Noirot have arrived at numerical
results so different, though less than
Sadler’s, that no thoroughly reliable conclusions
can be based upon them. Wall confesses
himself an adherent of this law, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
lays down the principle that in the intercourse
of two quite young parents the male
sex tends to predominate. If, on the contrary,
the age of the man is distinctly greater
than that of the woman, he insists on the
excess of females amongst the new-born.
The French breeder Girou de Buzareingues
is disposed in many respects to support the
theory of the influence of difference of age
in the parents upon sex of offspring; but,
also, on the strength of his own experiences
in breeding, is partially opposed to it. According
to his theory, he also takes into consideration
the character, the food, etc., of
the parents, and would have regard to their
size and strength. In this way he gave his
theory a much wider range. He mentions a
great number of facts which he observed in
the human subject. He outlines the expenditure
of force, mental and physical, entailed
on the parents by their occupation, and then
sets forth ten very precise particulars from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which, in any given case, the sex of the offspring
which will result from the wedlock in
question may be known. The following cases
from Girou may be mentioned. A vigorous
man married a corpulent, melancholy, elderly
blonde. Seven daughters were the result of
the marriage, all of them resembling their
father and grandfather. Many similar cases
are mentioned by Girou, all of which may be
found of interest to the reader, if he be inclined
to regard preponderance of temperament,
or physical disposition for procreation
of the species as important factors. Included
in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repertoire</i> of anecdotes are many interesting
and piquant details respecting the
results of the pairing of dissimilar temperaments
which might be quoted, were it not
that this would lead us too far from our subject,
and also be of no service in the present
inquiry.</p>

<p>Bidder is in many respects inclined to give
his assent to the theories of his predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and states that women who bear their first
child between the ages of twenty and twenty-one
produce more girls than boys (Düsing).
The older the woman is at the time of her
first parturition, the greater number of male
births. An excess of male births will occur
in the case of those who first give birth to
children between the ages of thirty and forty
(Eckhardt). Ahlfeld insists that this is a
universal rule in the case of women who become
pregnant in later years. A great number
of specialists are of this opinion, and
apply the data afforded by statistics to support
it in different ways.</p>

<p>The evidence of Stieda, Berner, and Birelli,
and especially that of Wilkens, respecting the
domesticated mammals, leads, however, to this
conclusion, that the theories respecting the
relative proportions of male and female births
set forth by Sadler and Hofacker must either
be given up or their value considerably discounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Specialists are also to be found who, in
order to explain this theory, have availed
themselves of Darwin’s law, and in a certain
measure the results admit of this explanation.</p>

<p>The older parent, who evidently under such
normal circumstances as might be anticipated
has a shorter time to live than the younger
individual, his consort, naturally in the struggle
for life, makes an effort for the preservation
of his sex. Accordingly, the elderly husband
of a young wife, or <i>vice versâ</i>, the elderly
wife of a young husband, will make an effort
to preserve the sex which is first threatened
with death, but which may at least be replaced
by a majority of births.</p>

<p>In so far as these theories are mere calculations
and results which have originated from
comparisons of numbers (the numbers themselves
being in many cases of no practical
value), the conclusions reached may appear
to be astonishing, and may be used to support
either one view or another, or to contradict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
them. Only one fact appears to be
certainly established, that, on an average,
under normal circumstances, the number of
male individuals of our population that are
born exceeds the number of females. The
difference amounts to a small and variable
number per cent., but in the case of the
new-born, the excess is on the side of the
males. (Süssmilch.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far we have given such data as statistics
have furnished. These, it is true, belong
principally to past epochs, and no new
results of this sort have been used by statisticians.
But it would be equally impossible
to deduce from new statistics, or from old, or
from both together, any law of nature affecting
the question before us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall proceed next to examine the further
theories on this subject with which I have
become acquainted from the perusal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
literature treating of it. With some of the
works which I am about to mention I am acquainted
at first hand. Others I know only
from quotations found in various technical
publications. I have not attempted to arrange
my materials in any other way.</p>

<p>In the case of the most widely different
branches of natural science, and whether the
author’s aim be descriptive or experimental,
it is a common practice to commence with a
glimpse at what has been said by the earliest
writers. I shall begin in the same way. I
shall, however, not take into consideration
what has been at various times mere folk-lore,
and is only traditionally known, but shall
limit myself to such traditions as have been
preserved in writing. I have, besides, already
spoken above of suppositions respecting the
origin of sex which appear to partake of the
nature of myths. To these it was impossible
to attach any importance. And the same
must be said of other views which belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the epoch of the Greek or Latin writers on
natural science, and are so strange that they
can be scarcely brought into any agreement
with modern knowledge.</p>

<p>In Ploss’s work ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Weib in der Natur
and Völkerkunde</i>’ (Woman in Nature and
Popular Tradition), are to be found the various
speculations of different races respecting
the origin of sex. Much of this folk-lore is
of a distinctly surprising character, and calculated
to afford the reader considerable
amusement. For example, in Servia, if a
man has a stye on his eyelid he comes to
the conclusion that his aunt is pregnant. If
the stye is on the upper eyelid, the child will
be a male, if on the lower, a female.</p>

<p>Amongst the Asiatic races religious ceremonies,
prayers, and similar expedients are
considered efficacious, and capable of influencing
the sex.</p>

<p>What question is there of the present day,
respecting which we can consult the literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the ancients, that does not take us back
to the writings of Hippocrates, Aristotle, or
Galen, or to those of the old authors of those
oriental races whom we regard as the earliest
cultivated peoples? Hippocrates held that to
produce a male, the generative material must
be of a stronger quality. The future destiny
of the male rendered it necessary that it
should be constructed on a stouter foundation.
He must be capable of a stronger development,
and must, therefore, be a product of
stronger elements alike on the father’s and
the mother’s side. A second hypothesis was
soon added to this primary one, but without
any foundation of facts.</p>

<p>According to Aristotle, the woman supplied
the primary material for the development of
the future individual. It was the function
of the man to give the impulse, in consequence
of which the future individual came
into being. Next followed the purely mythical
theory, already mentioned, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Anaxagoras believed. The much-sought-for
origin of the future difference of sex in the
various individuals was assigned to the right
or left side of the organism. And Galen even
concluded that the right side of the body was
the warmer, and the left the colder, further
claiming for the warmer side the privilege
of producing male individuals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Various notions respecting the origin of
sex have been also accommodated to these
primitive theories of the ancients, without
resting upon any positive foundation. No
evidence exists to show from whom they originated,
nor how they were disseminated.
Nevertheless, the historical connection of these
speculations justifies a reference to them, and
various hypotheses of this kind will be found
in a little publication of Dr. Heinrich Janke’s
(Stuttgart, 1896). The older literature on the
subject of the generation of the sexes has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
been collected by His. (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv für Anthropologie,
Vol. IV. V.</i>) In ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Weib in der Natur
and Völkerkunde</i>’ (Leipzig), Ploss has collected
ample information concerning both
ancient and modern ideas on this subject
amongst the different races of mankind. The
procreative elements, furnished by the male
and female organs, after their mixture, compete
with each other, by virtue of their inherent
forces, for the mastery. In this conflict,
if the male molecules are the more
numerous, a male results. On the contrary,
if the female molecules are more numerous,
the result is a female. Nicholaus Venette
ascribes the difference of sex to the earliest
phases of the life of the ovule.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following aspect of the origin of sex
is not without interest, although the theory
rests on somewhat insufficient foundations,
and is applicable, in the first instance, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to those creatures which produce but a single
individual at a birth. Many creatures, and
especially certain species of birds, present
this phenomenon; they lay in a single month
two eggs. Of these, one is male, the other
female. In this way a provision is made for
the equal increase, in each respective month,
of both sexes. In the case of man, it would,
in accordance with this, be anticipated that
naturally an equal number of ova of either
sex would be produced by a single individual.</p>

<p>This would lead to the supposition that, in
the case of the human female, in one month
a male ovule would reach its perfect development,
and in the next month, anterior to the
occurrence of the menses, a female ovule.
Thus the ovary of the human female would
contain in one month a male ovum capable
of fecundation, and in the following month
a similar female ovum. After a woman had
once given birth to a child it would then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
possible to form a correct idea of the distribution
of the ova of the different sexes.
The month of birth and the sex of the new-born
child would be known, and starting
from the datum that it would be the turn of
the ovum of the next month to develop the
opposite sex, it would be possible to fix the
given month in which an individual of the
male or female sex should be developed.
(Dupuys.)</p>

<p>To these less general explanations of the
origin of sex belong certain very startling
theories dealing with the question before us.
These notions are set forth at great length
in theoretical explanations put in the shape
of popular expositions. According to these
views a single cell of the male or female
reproductive glands is regarded as a sort of
complicated compound structure that might
be compared to a spherical world, in which
thousands of primal individuals are contained,
from whose powerful and secret activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
results the formation of male or female individuals.
(Hinz. Neusalz am Oder, 1897.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another very common opinion is that the
seasons (Düsing), the climate, and other local
circumstances, have an effect in determining
the sex of the embryo. If the data supplied
by Birelli, Berner, C. F. Vilson, and Felkin,
and many other authors, be taken together,
it appears that the different zones of the
earth’s surface are not without influence in
the reproduction of one sex rather than the
other. More boys appear to be born in the
north; in the warmer south more girls.</p>

<p>Felkin and Vilson adduce the following instance
from the south of Egypt:—The Wagandas,
a warlike race, kill the men and the
old women of their conquered foes. The
children, girls, and young women they lead
into captivity. On one occasion 480 of the
women gave birth to children on their march.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Of the new-born 79 were boys, 403 girls.
This incident led the author to pay further
attention to the subject on the east coast of
Africa and in the Soudan. Everywhere he
found the anticipation of an excess of girls
supported and confirmed. In fact his investigations
of the phenomenon led him to
formulate and advocate a law that the better
nourished and superior parent tends to produce
the opposite sex.</p>

<p>In this case the women are in an inferior
position, and in consequence worse nourished
and practically exhausted. Amongst other
neighboring races, where they live peaceably
and domestically, the difference between the
number of new-born boys and girls is not a
very great one, although a small average appears
in favor of the girls. The influence
of different phases of the moon has also
been taken into consideration, and has been
described as so effective that some have even
attempted to prognosticate by these means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the sex of a second child after the birth of a
first. (Lioy.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From Vilson’s statement that the sex of
the worse-fed parent perpetuates itself, a theory
has been deduced which has been described
as <i>cross-heredity of sex</i> (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gekreuzte Geschlechtsvererbung</i>).
In accordance with this theory a
prominent phenomenon would be that the
individual parents were not in a position to
propagate their own sex, but were yet under
certain circumstances capable of reproducing
the opposite sex. If the father were the
stronger, a girl would result from the next
impregnation; in the opposite case, a boy.
A great number of authors of renown, most
of whom are mentioned in works dealing
with these questions, are supporters of this
theory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have already mentioned that there are
some who regard the act of generation as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
conflict in consequence of which the sex of
the elder parent, whether father or mother,
will be reproduced, so that the sex in question
may maintain its position. Similarly, in
the case of the so-called cross-heredity of sex
there seems to be a conflict for the preservation
of the opposite sex. What conception
we are to form of this conflict seems a difficult
question. Any measure of the greater
or less excitability of the centers during the
act of generation (which might be determined
in the case of animals) is not easily to be
reached with any degree of probable correctness;
and how much less any numerical index
which would express the differences of
excitability, of strength, and so forth, which
might be developed during the conflict of
the opposite sexes. The theory of the cross-heredity
of sex rests upon the phenomenon
that those female animals which are impregnated
by sexually inferior and older males,
whose capacity for reproduction must be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as inferior to that of the females,
produce more male than female individuals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a queen-bee lays male eggs, it is often
asserted that these are not yet fecundated.
It is only after they have been impregnated
by the male that the female individuals appear.
That is to say, after the male influence
has had its effect, the causes which lead to
the development of the female make themselves
apparent, in accordance with the theory
of the cross-heredity of sex. Previously, this
influence was wanting, and, in consequence,
only male individuals resulted from the eggs.</p>

<p>From the unfructified eggs of Daphnia
(water-flea) many individuals are at once developed,
and in numbers so great as to be
surprising. According to Heincke, female
individuals can be developed from eggs which
have not been fructified, but have been well
nourished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Clarke, a medical man of Detroit, is of
opinion that in the commixture of the elements,
which serve as the basis of the future
individual, some external force is also embodied.
Then the situation would be something
like this: there are two elemental
forms, which, in impregnation, are brought
near each other, and their union actually effected;
of these the female ovum has the
function of occasioning a male offspring, and
the male element that of occasioning a female.
In this act a conflict is supposed to take place,
in which each sex strives for the production
of the opposite sex. But here there would
be also an expenditure of force on behalf of
its own sex. This appears to be a labor of
love on the part of the sexually more ardent
consort, to which he or she finds himself or
herself prompted by nature for the sake of
the weaker female or male sex, but at the
same time without any conscious volition of
accomplishing an expenditure of power or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
energy in this (reflex) act. Richarz affirms
that it is the function of the man to produce
a higher degree of organization during the
development in the germ. But if the productive
force of the mother is more energetic,
and exerts a greater influence, the result is
a boy. When, on the contrary, the generative
force excited in the mother by successful
fecundation is weaker, the fecundated
germ does not attain the masculine sex.</p>

<p>Cases from married life are mentioned by
different authors in which the husband, partly
in consequence of sexual debility, occasioned
by repeated seminal emissions on previous
occasions, partly in consequence of advanced
age, and besides, also, through spermatic secretion
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Samensecretion</i>), was scarcely capable
of performing his conjugal duties, nevertheless,
pregnancy ensued, which after nine
months resulted in the birth of a boy. In
these cases the mother would have decided
the sex of the child. But one is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
inclined to explain the origin and development
of a boy in these cases by the law of
cross-heredity of sex. It may certainly be
concluded from these cases that a man, from
whom it might have been supposed that no
procreative substance was to be had, although
he can be reckoned amongst the patriarchs of
his species, may yet sometimes be able to
boast that he has left male offspring to be
his direct heir.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Guttceit relates that a
man, during the period anterior to his having
a mistress, and whilst he was entirely at the
service of his wife, begot only daughters.
When, however, he limited the time which
he spent with his wife by devoting a part to
a mistress, his wife presented him with male
offspring. This is a case which might be explained
by the law of cross-heredity of sex.</p>

<p>Serious surgical interference with the female
certainly has an effect upon fecundation.
At least, pregnancy appears to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
postponed after the more difficult operations.
If, however, impregnation takes place, either
male or female offspring may be anticipated.
This contradicts the theory of cross-heredity
of sex, according to which only individuals
of one sex should appear, if one ovary has
been removed.</p>

<p>Facts which have been brought to light by
experiments with animals, and by observation
in the human subject, tend to give the theory
of cross-heredity of sex a higher value. But
under the same circumstances, other phenomena
present themselves to observation
which appear to render some of the postulates
of this theory untenable. Various diseases
which are diagnosed by medical men
as organic disorders, but which do not interfere
with the power of reproduction, are
apparently without influence on the sex of
the offspring, and also without influence
upon a striking prevalence of one or the
other sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Richarz assigns all the power to the fecundated
female individual. He thus raises the
culminating point of the female power of
reproduction to a height above that which
other specialists will allow. In this he is in
complete disagreement with Roth, to whom
he is also opposed in other directions. Within
certain individual limits (amongst which is
not to be included a diminution of capacity
in consequence of the necessary periodical
functional impulses), the female organism discharges
its functions the more frequently and
the more perfectly the less often it is called
into operation, and, <i>e contra</i>, the less frequently
and the less perfectly the more often
it is called into operation. According to Vernich,
very long intervals between successive
pregnancies disturb the progressive increase
in the weight of the children less than very
short ones.</p>

<p>One may, without being afraid of making
any great mistake, at any rate in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
women who bear many children, make the
same assertion respecting the constantly increasing
probability of male offspring, as respecting
the increase of weight.</p>

<p>The beneficial effect of a fairly long fallow
season upon these periodically acting organs
is revealed in this way among others, that,
often enough, in consequence of prolonged
rest and recovery of strength, the female generative
organs, after frequent still births, became
capable of producing healthy children.
(Richarz.)</p>

<p>The fundamental law of crossing is supported
by this author in every direction. He
recommends it as revivifying the blood and
tissues, in order to combat the evil effects
of inbreeding, the exhaustion of normal and
healthy conditions, and as a preventative
against the appearance of degeneration and
decay. A similar relation between the sexes
exists in their functions for the continuation
of the species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>If an attempt be made (Richarz) to explain
the different facts observed, in accordance
with the theory in question, no insuperable
contradictions will be met with. The general
excess of male births, their corresponding increase
during the loss of many men in war
(a loss of distinctly stronger men), the high
proportion of male births in the case of
mothers who produce their first-born at a
comparatively late age, the same high proportion
where polygamy prevails, and, further,
the diminution of male births in the
case of unmarried mothers, which should
not be overlooked,—all these phenomena are
declared to be in accord with Richarz’s
views.</p>

<p>We will proceed here to give a brief sketch
of Richarz’s opinion. Ribot powerfully supports
it in every particular from his own
experience and from historical data. The
primary impulse upon which the whole process
of generation depends lies in the organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the mother. Here lies also the substratum
in which is, as it were, the center of gravity
of the special generative process.</p>

<p>The function of the male sex is to evoke
from the feminine substratum an organism, or,
more strictly speaking, to occasion a change
in the germ. If the mother’s generative capacity
reaches the highest point the result is
a boy, who in external appearance resembles
his mother.</p>

<p>If, however, it happens that the forces
which act in the mother are inferior to those
of the father, the infant will be a female.
She will resemble her father, and will also
inherit her father’s temperament. Sex is
not a transmissible attribute inherited directly
from the parents. Personal appearance
and other characteristics will on the whole
correspond rather more with one of the parents
than with the other. Yet in every case
the influence of the other parent will make
itself felt, and will in many respects exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a modifying influence over external appearance
and other characteristics.</p>

<p>These views have been attacked by Roth,
who declares himself against Richarz’s hypotheses.
His objections are contained in a
work entitled ‘The Phenomena of Heredity’
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ueber die Thatsachen der Vererbung</i>). He
directly attacks the theory of cross-heredity
of sex, and according to his theory claims
for each parent an equal share in the formation
of the future individual, at least in the
earliest stages. Fecundation, according to
Roth, would at once be effective in determining
the sex of the future individual.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion hereafter to speak
of the observations which Mayerhofer has
made upon the origin of sex. Here we
shall mention only a single fact. This is a
result of his experiments with animals, and
seems to have a relation to the theory of
cross-heredity of sex.</p>

<p>Ewes impregnated by a powerful ram bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
more males than females, so long as the ram
is in possession of his full forces. After a
time the ram has to perform his functions
repeatedly during a few days, as great numbers
of the ewes are rutting. The fatigued
or exhausted ram then begets only females.</p>

<p>Next the number of rutting ewes diminishes.
The ram gradually recovers his
strength. Whilst constantly employing it
with the remaining rutting ewes he again
begets male individuals. Now, according to
the rule of cross-heredity of sex, the number
of females ought to be greatest at the outset,
because we here have a male of exceptional
force. When the ram is exhausted, according
to the theory of cross sexual heredity the
males ought to be more numerous. It appears,
therefore, that in this experiment of
Mayerhofer’s we have something which remains
in want of explanation. We shall presently
have occasion to speak more fully of
the facts which this author communicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
respecting the origin of sex in man, and will
then return to this subject.</p>

<p>The information which we have concerning
a stallion (Sir Hercules) belonging to the stud
of Count Lehndorff deserves attention. This
stallion was twenty-six years old, and had to
cover twenty-three mares. The result was
twenty-four foals of the male sex. This case
of the ardent mares and the old stallion can
be explained by the theory of cross-heredity
of sex.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be here directed
to a phenomenon which seems to imply that
a sexually exhausted individual always has
his advantage of propagating his own sex
secured. It is a sort of fulfilment of duty on
the part of a strong female animal when
her litter shows a majority of male individuals,
or male individuals only. In this connection
may be mentioned the facts communicated
by Settegast, Nathusius-Hundisburg,
and De la Tellais, who arrived at their results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from experiments upon the proportions of the
sexes of the offspring of the domesticated
mammalia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Attempts to solve the problem of the origin
of difference of sex by means of experiments
have been numerous. So early as the last
century Platz attempted to carry out experiments
with living animals.</p>

<p>The temperaments of the breeding couple
ought to be concordant. Both should be
either of warm or cool temperament. Warmth
and moisture are primary conditions of fertility,
not in plants alone, but amongst the
animals also; and (as Mayoor Zsigmond, of
Kaschau, proclaimed in 1723) represent the
primary conditions of the possibility of a conception.</p>

<p>The warm element belongs to the man; the
moist to the woman. Where both qualities
are to be found in both, offspring may also
be anticipated. But if this be not the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for example, if the man’s warmth does not
accord with that of his wife, but is of a
higher degree, then he can beget boys. If
he be not so warm, he must, if he wishes
for sons, make a distinct alteration in his
diet. According to the prescription given,
he ought to lead a regular life and to limit
himself strictly to warm and dry aliments.
The temperament of the woman is often ardent
and dry. In this state it must be regarded
as unfitted for the development of an embryo.
Befitting food would not be without an influence
upon the alteration of temperament.
Respecting this, experiments had proved this
much, that a suitable change of diet can exercise
a salutary influence over the temperament.
A woman who was in the highest
degree beautiful in face and in every part
comely had a temperament which would accord
with that of any man.</p>

<p>Then comes the theory of the allotment of
the male and female in man, and in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
vertebrata, to the right and left sides of organs
of generation. This is a theory which
is being always brought forward, even by the
most recent writers, some of whom go so far
as actually to wish to support it by experiments.</p>

<p>Thus the excision of one or the other of
the testicles of the male is recommended in
order that the owner may be able to breed
the sex which he desires. It still remains, in
order to effect the artificial determination of
the sex, that the female should also play her
part correctly, so that the semen of the male
may be conveyed to an ovule from the required
ovary. An effort was accordingly
made to secure intercourse in such a manner
that the semen of the male might be
delivered in a certain direction in agreement
with the anatomical position of the duct
which was to lead the seed into the required
ovary. But it was practically difficult to settle
what position in the intercourse was the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
one. Experience proved that in a certain
case on two successive occasions male individuals
were born when the impregnation
had been so contrived that the semen should
enter the right ovary. Therefore the left
ovary was for female offspring. It is not
our concern to enter into further explanations
of these occurrences. Only this much
may be said, that experiments have been
constantly made which might lead to some
conclusive solution of these questions, without
any result having been obtained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A publication appeared in the year 1786
dealing with the above-mentioned theory, and
at the time attracted much attention. It has
now become difficult to procure, and is often
mentioned on account of its containing much
that is valuable for influencing sex, both
amongst men and animals, that has been
gathered from all the authors of the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
century, and more especially from all the
ancient authors who had written on this subject.</p>

<p>The author was J. Ch. Hencke, organist at
Hildesheim, and the title of his book, ‘The
Secret of Nature Completely Discovered, both
in the Procreation of Man, and for the absolute
choice of the Sex of Children.’ Brunswick,
1786. (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Völlig entdecktes Geheimniss der
Natur, sowohl in der Erzeugung des Menschen
als auch in der willkürlichen Wahl des
Geschlechts der Kinder.</i> <i>Braunschweig, 1786.</i>)
The author relies upon exploded theories, according
to which the offspring is evolved, as
it were, out of a mixture of the generative
secretions of the two sexes, and can be induced
to develop into either a male or female
individual. Thus the sex is not previously
determined, only in the course of its development
out of the developing mass, which
consists of a mixture of male and female
generative secretions, distinctive sexual characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
make their appearance, according
to the predominance of the male or female
portion of the mixture. But here, also, the
old theory is set forth very precisely. The
generative matter of the right testicle serves
to fructify ova from which males are developed,
that of the left testicle is used to fructify
and develop female ova. Similarly, the
tenet is propounded that the right ovary contains
male ova and the left such only as will,
when developed, produce female offspring.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These doctrines, as a basis for the breeding
of animals, Hencke had discovered by
castrating swine, dogs, and rabbits. Thus it
happened that a boar, who, after castration,
had only the left testicle, twice running bred
with a sow female young only. Similar phenomena
occurred with other animals, so that
this method was recommended by the author
to the breeders of his time. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
happened, also, that a surgeon upon opening
the body of a woman who had had
sons only and never a single daughter,
found the left ovary very thin and withered,
so that it was hardly possible that it
could serve for the development of a new
individual. On the contrary, the right ovary
was in a normal condition. It now remained
only to discover some device for man, by
which he might be able, during the act of
generation, to avail himself of the discoveries
thus made, so as to obtain the result of an
absolute choice of the sex of the offspring.
The ligation of one of the testicles was
Hencke’s infallible remedy. When this severe
proceeding proved impracticable, in its place
was substituted an elevation of the testicle
by means of its suspending muscle (the cremaster).
Under certain conditions this takes
place of itself in particular positions, and was
accordingly recommended as an established
proceeding for men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>One other conclusion of Hencke’s deserves
particular mention. He was bold enough not
only to assert that the right and left sexual
glands served exclusively for the generation
of male and female individuals, respectively,
but also asserted that the generative matter
from the right or left gland of one parent
was productive only when united with that
of the same gland of the other parent. His
counsels were not for such persons as are too
heated, too ardent. “For young, hot, hasty
men,” he says, “who are altogether without
consideration, I am not writing; but for
chaste married people, and especially for
those to whom the production of a child of
one or the other sex is a matter of importance.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Couteau established the fact that each seminal
duct had its own orifice, through which
the semen was poured into the urethra. This
fact was in his days of the greatest importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
as it prevented any mixture of the
semen of a man’s two testicles. Hencke
firmly insisted that the semen was discharged
by one testicle or seminal vesicle alone, in
the case when the testicle was raised up.
But we need not here follow further Hencke’s
theories which he deduced from his own experiments.
In the present day these theories
will satisfy no one. Results which have been
obtained either after ovariotomy, or after the
extirpation of testicles, have made us perfectly
certain about the value of one or the
other generative gland for the production of
the male or female sex. The case of Schatz,
which has been also pointed to us as important
in other specialist works, may not be
uninteresting here. The left ovary of a
young girl was removed, together with a
portion of the left tube, and the right ovary,
also, with the exception of a margin of about
two millimetres’ breadth. When she was married
she gave birth to a girl, whereas a boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
should have been expected, seeing that only
male offspring were to be produced by the
right ovary.</p>

<p>Scarcely any work that lies before us on
this subject is so much regarded as that of
Hencke. At the same time, and although it
had in its day the widest circulation, it frequently
met with the most unqualified condemnation.
Dr. von Seligson, in his discourse before
the Society of Medical Practitioners at Moscow
(1895), on the subject of influencing the development
of sex, in connection with Hencke’s
theory, attached value to a great number of
experiments tending to support the old view.
It was, however, admitted that by a departure
of nature from the ordinary law (somewhat
resembling a transposition of the viscera) male
or female ova might occur in the respectively
opposite ovaries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>De Bay, who was opposed to the theory of
the anteriorly-developed sexual products of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the right and left ovaries, asserts that the
quality of the generative products depends
upon the quantity of nitrogen existing in the
chemical composition of the ovum and the
semen. A large proportion of nitrogen in
the ovum occasions the development of a
girl. If, on the contrary, the semen contains
a great quantity of nitrogen, a male individual
will result. To determine the proportion of
nitrogen, or to give it scientific value in such
cases, seems to be a difficult matter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mention is also made of cases of tubal
pregnancy in which the sex was determined,
and an effort has been made here, also, to find
some support for the theory of the existence
of sex in the ovum whilst in the ovary on
the right or left side. Fourteen of these
tubal pregnancies, described by different authors,
showed boys on the right and girls on
the left side. (Seligson.) In such anomalous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
cases where the embryo has developed itself
in the Fallopian tube, and has not reached
the uterine cavity, there is no doubt that the
developed ovum originated in the ovary of
the side on which it was found.</p>

<p>Efforts are made to confute the different
objections raised in many quarters. The mention
made by the traveler, Peter Kolben, of
the practice of cutting out one testicle, which
is the custom of certain African tribes (this
is contradicted by Le Vaillant [1784], and by
Fritsch [1880]), and the accounts of Otto
Finsch, may not deserve credit, as they rest
upon assertions made by other persons. Accounts
are further given, drawn from medical
experience, of men who, after prolonged
orchitis, with consequent occlusion of the
vas deferens, begot only children of one
sex, or in other cases were unable to induce
pregnancy. Also the discharge of semen was
asserted not to take place from both spermatic
ducts at the same time. After many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
digressions, Seligson in the end adheres to
Hencke’s theory on no sufficient grounds, and
then bases on that theory a method, upon
which I shall not here pass judgment, but
merely mention it without describing it.</p>

<p>At all events, there can be no question of
a compression of the spermatic cord in any
way, for it could not be accomplished, either
manually or with the aid of various kinds of
apparatus, without giving rise to excessive
pain.</p>

<p>In this case, as Hencke in his time explained,
the cremaster muscle raises the testicle
up towards the inguinal canal. At
complete erection the testicle is drawn up
and pressed against the inguinal ring. This
gives more favorable conditions for leading
the semen forward from this one of the two
testicles; and this portion of the semen is
used for impregnation, to which end also a
favorable attitude and a free passage into
the ovary must be provided. According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the views of the author, this method, if
adopted in procreation, will lead to the desired
result of producing a given sex. Exceptions
are admitted. Exceptions occurred
in five families with twenty-three children.
The author clings firmly to his theory that
each testicle possesses its own special spermatozoa
and each ovary its special ova, in
which a given sex is already in existence,
and from which in fruitful intercourse male
or female individuals originate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next after a number of theories which
have been current on this subject, we reach
some others, to which more or less value has
been attributed. Morello attached weight to
the concentration of the semen. Thin, liquid
semen was to be favorable to the production
of females; thick semen produced males. According
to modern theories, based upon observation
of invertebrate animals (O. Hertwig,
Balfour, Landois, Minot, and others), it appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
improbable that this position can be maintained.
The supporters of this theory assert
that a single spermatozoon suffices for the fertilization
of an ovule, or to develop the ovum
into a so-called “oosperm,” that is to say, to
form a really fertilized ovum. (Perhaps the
excess of semen serves for the earliest nutritive
processes of the ovum; which would,
however, be difficult to prove.) This fact
has been also confirmed in the case of the
higher animals, and it might be in a similar
manner brought to an issue in the case of
man. However, observations of this kind
have not yet proved possible with man. But
in the case when several spermatozoa penetrate
the interior of a single ovum, anomalies
in the process of development result from
the formation of several nuclei. Such ova,
also, perhaps in consequence of excess of
semen, are very often aborted and perish.</p>

<p>In order to throw light on the causes determining
sex, Pflüger (in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
results obtained by Born, which will be cited
later) attempted to determine the relative
numbers of the sexes, under normal conditions,
in the case of the frog (<i>Rana fusca</i>).
The numbers were taken by his pupils, A.
von Griesheim and Dr. W. Kochs. The
identification of the sex was made with a
microscope under the supervision of Pflüger.
According to Pflüger the Graafian follicles
are easily identified with the aid of a microscope,
if they are not in their earliest stage.
They contain an ovum with a scanty yolk
and large germinal vesicles with germinal
markings. The whole is surrounded by connective
tissue.</p>

<p>According to Pflüger, the epithelium is
wanting in such very young follicles. In
these frogs after their metamorphosis the
testicle consists of tubes, with multinuclear
epithelia, and is easily distinguishable from
the always large ovaries of the tadpoles. By
different concentrations of semen, Pflüger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
attempted to influence the proportion between
the male and female sexes.</p>

<p>According to Pflüger, there are normally
found amongst frogs in a state of nature 36.3
per cent. males, and 63.7 per cent. females.
With thinner or thicker semen, the average
number can be altered. With thin semen
Pflüger obtained 27.3 males and 72.7 females
per cent. With concentrated semen he obtained
39.4 males, and 60.6 females. Pflüger
carried out some other experiments, and
came to the conclusion that the concentration
of the semen or the extract from the
testicles exercised either a very small influence
or no influence at all upon the sex.
When he took an average result from all his
experiments, he found that out of 806 frogs
which he raised, 288 were males. Whilst the
normal proportion of the males developed
freely under natural conditions was 36.3 per
cent., that reached by experiment was 35.7
per cent. It should be here remarked that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
among the tadpoles many are found whose
sex is not yet determined. They are in a
hermaphrodite condition, out of which they
develop into either males or females.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robin, the well-known French histologist,
made the question of the origin of sex the
subject of an extensive inquiry. His investigations
start from the following point:—In
warm climates the whole quantity of blood
in the inhabitants is less than in temperate
zones. The process of respiration in the inhabitants
of warm climates is also not so
free as in the case of those who inhabit
temperate or cold zones.</p>

<p>From this it would seem that some process
connected with nutrition, and with the passage
of nourishment into the blood, is the
cause of the number of male births being
greater in the cold zones than it is in the
temperate zones, or in the inhabited regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lying nearer to the equator. It would follow
from these considerations, that if the
women were subjected to such a régime as
would materially affect their respiration and
the quality of their blood, more boys than
girls, or the contrary, might be bred. If so,
breathing an atmosphere containing more oxygen,
with a corresponding diet, would be the
right receipt for producing in the woman such
a basis that in the course of development the
male generative organs (which Robin considers
the anatomically more perfectly developed)
might be evolved instead of the female. According
to Robin, the male sexual apparatus
in comparison with that of the female is provided
with the more perfectly developed character.
Robin further insists that strong men
will beget more male individuals. Further,
that a woman who indulges in sexual intercourse
somewhat seldom has female children;
and that voluptuous women, who are fruitful,
generally bear boys. A number of experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with domesticated mammalia are adduced
in support of this view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hegar teaches that in the case of a merely
rudimentary development of the germinal
gland either sex is developed.</p>

<p>With the views of Robin may be connected
also other suggestions regarding the food of
the parents. These have been tried both with
men and animals. But we shall not here go
further into them. Nor shall we mention the
different kinds of food or drink which have
been employed, whether by men or women,
to produce a greater sexual activity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The eminent naturalist Born, of Breslau,
made a long series of experiments, which
are of the highest interest in reference to the
doctrine of the origin of sex. It is easy to fertilize
frogs’ eggs artificially. The ripe eggs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
taken directly from the female, and the testicles
of the male rubbed with water. This
fluid, which now contains spermatozoa, serves
to fertilize the eggs. Spallenzani had already
undertaken artificial fructification. Born observed,
during his study of the course of development,
that the effect of his breeding as
regarded sex was to produce 95 per cent. of
females. This number is evidently so remarkable
that it ought to secure particular
attention. No such extreme contrast between
the numbers of males and females is to be
found amongst the frogs that develop freely
under natural circumstances. It seemed to
Born that his result was to be referred to
insufficient nourishment, and that the tadpoles,
being somewhat unfavorably circumstanced,
had not been able to attain the
development of the stronger sex. In this experiment
on the evolution of sex it appeared
that not only was there an excessive production
of females, but that the other organs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the embryo and its whole constitution could
be modified by means of nutrition. It is
also to be observed respecting this most interesting
experiment that many of the tadpoles
perished of hunger. Now, the number
of still-born males of the human species very
much exceeds the number of still-born girls.
The mortality amongst males is so great that
the average is from 136 to 140 still-born boys
to 100 still-born girls. An attempt has been
made (Pflüger) to explain this phenomenon
in the human subject on the ground that the
tenacity of life in the female sex in the
period of embryonal existence exceeded that
of the male. Consequently, boys would more
easily perish during development than girls.
If this observation made with respect to human
beings were applied to the tadpoles, it
might also explain the high percentage which
the females showed among the frogs. Very
likely the male tadpoles possessed less capacity
of resistance; or, in other words, were less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
tenacious of life than the females. It will
be understood that this view would apply only
as a partial explanation of the facts set forth
by Born.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the artificial breeding of trout, which is
conducted under cover, in which process the
embryos which have crept out of the ovarian
follicle are kept with the yolk-sacs in small
reservoirs under a continuous flow of water,
it is observed that single individuals develop
themselves further. They lose their store of
yolk with the yolk-sacs. In the course of their
further development and nutrition they arrive
only very slowly at the development of the
internal generative organs. Even in a very
advanced stage the sex is not yet so plainly
indicated as in fish of the same size living
free. Indeed, it is even affirmed by many
persons of experience that in the artificial
breeding of trout even those that have attained
their full growth remain unfruitful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
cannot be used for further breeding. (D’Audeville
and Arens raised, in the case of trout,
more females by dry impregnation.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here might be adduced also many other
doctrines of greater or less interest respecting
the theory of the origin of sexual distinction.
Only in order that I may not introduce
too much literary matter, I shall mention
only a few of the more important and noticeable
theories before I return once more to
the experiments upon the influence of food
upon the development of sex. Janke’s work
(small edition), published at Stuttgart in 1896,
furnishes a synopsis of the literary work
done, as do other books which treat of this
subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mons. Thury, professor at Geneva, published
at Leipzig, in the year 1863, a book
on the law of breeding the sexes, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on account of its contents, attracted great
attention. In this work the author, after a
number of successful experiments and other
investigations, shows how an influence may
be exerted over the sex of plants, animals,
and men.</p>

<p>This work stirred me up to the endeavor
to devote myself to this question, so far as
that might be possible. I shall give a short
sketch of Thury’s work, together with the
critical revision of it by Dr. H. A. Pagenstecher,
of Heidelberg.</p>

<p>The doctrine respecting the origin of sex
in cattle was laid down by Thury from his
own investigations. The principal point in
his doctrine of the origin of sex in animals
he considers to be the condition of the ovum
at the time when it is fertilized. If the ovum
has reached the stage of ripeness, which may
be described as an advanced stage, we may
expect to have, after fertilization has taken
place, a male individual, which will develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
itself out of the ovum. If, however, the
ovum has reached only an imperfect state of
ripeness when successful impregnation takes
place, then no such powerful and perfect
specimen of the race as the male is can be
developed, and the result of such an ovum is
always a female.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From this it follows that, according to
Thury, the cause of sex lies in the ovum developing
itself in the ovary, and the degree
of its ripeness is the only factor in the development
of one sex or the other.</p>

<p>It is not, however, shown what the systems
are by which such an ovum can be correctly
judged, so as to determine the different degrees
of ripeness. We now know very well
certain signs which appear upon the maturation
of the ovum, of which we shall not say
more here. Of these Thury could know nothing
in 1863, because at that time they had
not been discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the sex depends upon the ripeness
of the female’s ovum at the time of its fecundation.
In the case of its having reached
the highest degree of ripeness, a male is the
result. It is impossible for the ovum to
attain a higher degree of ripeness. If the
ovum of a human female has arrived at this
supreme degree of ripeness, it has reached
that stage in which it is capable of becoming
the basis of the most perfect living creature
which exists upon our globe.</p>

<p>Rutting is an external sign of the maturity
of the ovum amongst the lower animals.
When, during the rutting period, an ovum is
detached from the ovary, and passes through
the Fallopian tubes to the cavity of the
uterus, the fructification can take place at
the beginning of the rutting period. At this
period its ripeness is not so far advanced.
The result of the development of such an
ovum is a female. But when the fecundation
has taken place at the end of the rutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
period, the ovum has reached its highest degree
of development, and, if effectively fecundated,
it will become a male. It follows
that the signs of rutting should be carefully
studied, as in fact is habitually done by
practical farmers. The duration of the rutting
period and the influences which affect
fertilization should be accurately known in
order to lead to any practical result.</p>

<p>Females at their first conception would
usually produce, or would be particularly disposed
to produce, female individuals. Experiments
succeed better with such as have often
produced young. In their case the symptoms
which indicate the commencement or the conclusion
of the rutting are much more easily
determined, so that they are better adapted
for these experiments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We know well that in the case of the
lower animals when rutting, as in the case of
the human female during menstruation, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ovum is liberated from the follicle in the
ovary, and ordinarily passes away in the menstrual
discharge. In fact, a follicle of the
ovary bursts, and, to be precise, that one
which protrudes most beyond the surface of
the ovary. This bursting of the follicle has
not actually been observed. But that this
event takes place there can be no doubt, for
the locality of the fissure is perceptible, and
the ovum is found either at hand on the
ovary, or else on the fimbria. The increase
of fluid in the follicle of the ovary, and the
excessive charge of blood in the vessels on
the walls of the follicle, seem to be, without
any actual contraction taking place, the physiological
causes of the freeing of the ovum
from the follicle, so that it may come in contact
with the semen. Ovulation can take
place without intercourse. But sexual intercourse
can also favor ovulation; at least, it
appears to facilitate the separation of the
ovum from the ovary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Bischoff made known the fact of the separation
of the ovum from the follicle. He
showed that the presence of sperm in the
feminine organs of generation of the animals
was indifferent, that the rutting of the animal
was the index of the ripeness of the
ovum. Eimer, Beneke, Van Bamecke, and
Hensen, call attention to the phenomenon
which is observed in the case of bats, who
for a whole month before the detachment of
the ovum from the follicle have their uteri
full of semen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These processes which take place at rutting
time are attended with sexual excitement
and congestion of the external genitals. It
is not, however, necessary that these processes
should in the case of all animals occur
at the same time as ovulation. If rutting
animals are restrained from sexual intercourse,
the sexual excitement of the female
passes off; but the symptoms of rutting again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
make their appearance after a time. These
are the phenomena of the so-called rutting
season.</p>

<p>This rutting season lasts with sheep fourteen
days, with swine fifteen to eighteen
days; with cows, horses, and apes four weeks.
It corresponds to the menstruation of the
human female (Hensen). Many bitches admit
the dog only when six or seven days
have elapsed since the issue of blood. In the
case of many animals rutting is marked by a
flow of blood from the genitals. This is the
case with apes, bitches, swine, and many
other mammalia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under these circumstances, the symptoms
of rutting are sufficiently distinctly marked
to make it possible, as Thury suggests, to
determine the advanced state of ripeness or
its commencement in the ova. But it is
scarcely possible to say when the period of
ripeness commenced in this ovum or that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
An ovum which had begun to ripen early
may, at the beginning of the rutting time,
have attained to the condition of a male-producing
ovum. At the same time, others
which are fertilized at the conclusion of the
rutting, but had begun to ripen comparatively
late, may, at the end of the rutting
time, not yet have advanced far enough to
be able to develop male individuals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thury bases his doctrine on a number of
phenomena of the vegetable and animal
world, and upon various experiences in the
case of man. He also adduces many statistical
data in explanation and support of his
theory.</p>

<p>The observations on plants make it indisputably
clear that all the circumstances which
favor growth and ripening are favorable
conditions for the development of male organs.
If all these circumstances are lacking,
female organs are produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Dark and cold, for instance, cause the male
organs to perish. In recent times a great
number of extended studies of the phenomena
of vegetable life in this direction have
appeared. I may mention more particularly
the following experiments made by M. von
Treskow in Gorlitz with <i>Arisæma</i> (Verhandlungen
des Botanischen Vereins der Provinz
Brandenburg, 1895). This plant first produces
male flowers. In the later year, when
it has become larger, it produces female
flowers. The transition from the male flowers
of the early stage to the female flowers of
the later stage can be hastened at pleasure
by planting in rich garden mold and manuring
with horn shavings. If, on the other
hand, the plant be placed in poor, sandy soil,
it reverts to the male flowers. The same author
quotes in his essay a remark of Heyer’s
(Halle, 1884), who declares that no sufficient
observations exist respecting the influence
which different situations exert over sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>I adduce this instance, for the sake of remarking
respecting it, that on this subject
also controversies exist, which must be settled
by wider studies of the life of plants.</p>

<p>Cornaz has tried to derive from cows evidence
in support of Thury’s theory. He had
twenty-nine cows impregnated with attention
to the rutting time, and from twenty-nine
births received twenty-two females and seven
males. Cornaz attested his experiment by a
declaration, and the experiment was repeated
in the French state domains.</p>

<p>But the experiment alone was striking
enough to invite repetition. It also met with
partial success. But the plan was afterwards
entirely given up, perhaps in consequence of
disappointments.</p>

<p>In this case it very likely happened—as in
such experiments it very easily may happen—that,
in consequence of insufficient practical
knowledge on the part of the experimenter,
the actual commencement of the rutting time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was overlooked. In addition, it is well known
that animals, in consequence even of an
amount of exercise not very exhausting, and
in many other ways, as well as in consequence
of the food they have taken, may
exhibit variations in the activity of their rutting.
It is not, therefore, surprising if the
results of experiments show much that was
unexpected.</p>

<p>I here pass over a great number of proofs
which Thury gives in his essay. Funcke
(1866) made in his ‘Physiology’ the following
remarks on Thury’s theory:—“Although the
origin and determination of sex is not indisputably
proved to depend upon the degree
of ripeness of the ovum, it appears to me
that we have not reached the right time for
determining the factor upon which it does depend.
These experiments have been made to
repose upon a fact, which fact certainly proves,
beyond the possibility of dispute, a relation
between the fertilization of the ovum and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
subsequent sex. This fact is that, in the
case of certain creatures capable of parthenogenesis
(unisexual procreation), we find that,
from unfertilized ova one sex always results,
and from fertilized ova the other. But any
closer interpretation of this function of the
semen is rendered nugatory in advance by
this, that it is in some cases the male and
in others the female that results from the
unfertilized ova.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thury’s theory can be very suitably brought
into agreement with the theory of cross-heredity
of sex, and explained by the assistance
of that view. The cow, at the beginning
of her rutting, is not in a condition of
great sexual vigor. If the ovum be effectually
fertilized, it may be supposed that the bull,
in procreative activity the superior consort,
will be fitted not to reproduce his own sex,
but that of the weaker cow. At the end of
the rutting period the cow, which is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to the bull, has her ovum ripened to the
highest possible degree, and in consequence,
when compared, from a sexual point of view,
with the bull, is distinctly the stronger and
superior, and a male calf is in this case the
result of conception.</p>

<p>According to the theory of cross-heredity
of sex, female creatures should in the former
instance be produced, and in the latter males,
which same result is reached in accordance
with the theory of Thury.</p>

<p>Attempts have been also made to apply
Thury’s theory to the human species. The
menstruation of women has been compared
with the rutting of the lower animals, and
has been considered a protracted, oft-repeated
rutting. Now, as an ovum is specially developed
every month, it follows that this
ovum requires a certain part of a month to
attain a more or less advanced degree of
ripeness. According to this, the ova which
are fertilized a short time after menstruation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
will develop only female individuals, whilst
those which have had a longer time in which
to attain to ripeness would develop themselves
into males.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the womb ought,
about ten days before the beginning of menstruation,
to thicken itself distinctly in consequence
of a turgescence and dilatation of the
vessels. In consequence it appears swollen
and loosened, and it has reached the culminating
point of swelling when the menstruation
is at its highest. After menstruation
the swelling does not immediately decrease,
but lasts on for about nine days, until the
mucous membrane returns to its normal condition.
(Hensen.) Thus it seems that the
swelling and hyperæmia in the womb appear
at the same time as the conditions which lead
to the ripening of the ovum. The fertilization
of the human ovum would be, therefore,
most efficacious at the time when the mucous
membrane of the womb is also most appropriately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
prepared, and it is probable that the
same moment is the one when all the other
coincident factors are of a sort best calculated
for the reception, the fixing, and the protection
of the ovum. It is simultaneously with
these processes in the mucous membrane of
the womb, and in the other parts of the generative
organs of the woman, that the ripening
of the ovum is effected.</p>

<p>Now, it may appear not to be a matter of
indifference (and may very likely even have
some connection with the development of
sex) whether the ovum is fertilized at a
period during which the mucous membrane
is passing through its changes in order to
reach its highest point of swelling, or at the
time, when, after menstruation, the mucous
membrane is, during so considerable a period
(nine days), passing through a retrograde
metamorphosis in order to return to its normal
condition. This protracted process seems
to correspond to the protracted rutting in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
form of a menstruation. If so, the human
uterus, as Thury’s theory would declare,
would be prepared, to a certain extent, in
different ways, for the reception of the ovum,
according to the different sex-conditions of
the future child.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not sufficiently known to how great
an extent the principles of Thury’s theory
have hitherto found their right application to
the case of man. They seem in practice to
be applied in different ways.</p>

<p>It seems that in cases where a result was
obtained it could be more easily explained by
the principles which have been already described
under the theory of cross-heredity of
sex. The assumption of a greater or lesser
degree of ripeness of the ovum which was to
be developed was a very questionable one.</p>

<p>The different processes with which we
have become, in more recent times, acquainted
as symptoms of the ripening of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ovum, are not here intended. Such symptoms
can be observed both in the ova of the invertebrata
and in those of the vertebrata.
These symptoms, which are such as the attainment
of the normal size of the ovum of
the species in question, the protrusion of the
orientation points (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Richtungskörperchen</i>), the
steps towards the formation of a female anterior
nucleus (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorkern</i>), etc., do not here
apply, for the recognition of that higher degree
of ripeness in the ovum which is necessary
at the time of fructification for the
development of a male individual.</p>

<p>All the above symptoms occur alike in the
ova destined for the male and for the female
sex. That ripeness of the ovum upon which
Thury’s theory insists, lies in the nature of
the ovum apart from any anatomical signs.
It is a condition of the ovum which we can
only attempt to explain by laying down the
principle that an ovum which has been for a
longer time prepared in the female generative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
organs previously to its fertilization, must be
riper than another which has had less time for
this preliminary process.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have mentioned above that on the
occasion of Thury’s experiment, the desired
result was effected in twenty-nine cases.
Pagenstecher, Siebold, and Köll have dealt
critically with Thury’s work. Coste was not
in a position to confirm these experiments,
nor to verify them. In order to test Thury’s
results as applied to the human subject,
Schröder obtained the assistance of young
women, who were in a position to give him
positive and accurate information respecting
the time at which they became pregnant.
The women could name the day on which
they had had sexual intercourse, and knew
the date of the last menses. From careful
calculation of the interval between these
dates, it was possible to ascertain approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
at what stage impregnation of the
ova took place, the degree of ripeness of the
impregnated ova could also be inferred from
the space of time that had elapsed since the
last menstruation, and the sex of the fœtus
was noted. Schröder found that on an average
of twenty-six cases in which boys were
born, the conception had taken place 10.08
days after menstruation; on an average of
twenty-nine cases in which girls were born,
9.76 days after. In consequence, he was not
able to confirm Thury’s theory in the case of
the human subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The experiments of Albini in Naples (according
to Kronecker’s report ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Centralblatt für
medicinische Wissenschaft</i>,’ 1868), which he
made during four years in his great poultry-yard
showed in the first place that hens for
eight days after being separated from the
cock laid none but fertile eggs. On the
ninth and tenth day the fertile and infertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
eggs were of equal number. On the twelfth
day all the eggs were infertile. Nevertheless
fertile eggs appeared even on the eighteenth
day. It is possible that they had been impregnated
by spermatozoa which had remained
in the folds of the mucous membrane of the
uterus.</p>

<p>Hens never yet impregnated, or such as
had not been impregnated for at least a
month, in three days (after impregnation)
laid fertile eggs, which increased in number
daily.</p>

<p>According to Albini, hens can in Naples
leave the eggs which they are hatching. The
shell can be partly broken off and again replaced
without the embryos necessarily perishing.
But care must be taken that no
fungoid growth reaches the germ, as this
is easily fatal to it. Indeed, it has been
recently shown that new-laid or well-preserved
eggs are free from all micro-organisms.
When these appear they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
made their way into the egg through the
mechanically injured or otherwise altered
calcareous shell. They do not have their
origin in the egg from the mother. The egg
of the bird is perfectly free from micro-organisms
when it is laid. If, however, only
traces of pure cultivations of micro-organisms
be in a suitable way applied to such eggs
externally (Lenderer), they always have a
fatal effect upon the developing germ, even
when they are not any of the so-called pathogenic
microbes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now the result of Albini’s breeding
experiments upon poultry with respect to the
origin of sex.</p>

<p>From three to six days after intercourse
with the cock the hens lay eggs, from which
on the average an equal number of males
and females are developed. In the warmer
part of the year the number of males appears
to be greater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Better nourishment of parents seems also to
exercise an influence over the sex of the young.</i></p>

<p>Such eggs as were laid from ten to fifteen
days after complete separation from the cock,
gave when hatched generally a distinctly
greater number of females. Albini found
that the greater number of these died of
anæmia. He ascribed that to imperfect fertilization,
and considered that development of
an excessive number of females was to be
ascribed to the same cause.</p>

<p>Albini inclines towards the theory of Thury,
in accordance with which the principal cause
of the development of sex lies in the degree
of ripeness of the ovum. He is opposed to
the theory of Coste and Gerbe, which declares
that the ova of the birds and mammals
are fertilized when they fall from the ovary.
The place where this took place was, according
to their theory, exactly localized, at the opening
of the Fallopian tube, and not at any
place in the length of the tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Fertilization in the Fallopian tube or uterus
is allowed to be possible, and it is admitted
that, in exceptional cases, fertilization of the
hen’s egg is possible so long as it is not surrounded
by the shell-membrane.</p>

<p>This opinion, however, is in direct contradiction
to that of Lenkart and Newport and
many others, who hold that the albumen,
which gathers around the yolk in the oviduct,
hinders the penetration of the spermatozoa
into the yolk. When Albini had collected his
facts he came to the conclusion that, in the
case of animals which bear many young, the
last are mostly male, and explains this by
the hypothesis that the ova passing through
the Fallopian tube thrust the semen back, so
that the ova which come behind are therefore
fertilized in a more advanced stage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meyer believes that he has incontestably
proved against Ahlfeld that the sex is determined
at conception. He does not appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
be disposed to admit the existence of male and
female ova in the ovary; but he thinks it
absolutely certain that the sex is determined
at conception by the reciprocal action of the
ovum and the semen. This view follows from
the fact that, as Thury’s theory demands, a
fertilization and a determination of the sex
must necessarily take place as regards time
either at the beginning or the end of the
mingling of semen and ovum.</p>

<p>The longer the ovum exists free from the
ovary, the longer it remains without the surrounding
of those elements (contained in the
ovary) which are necessary to it. Apparently,
in consequence of the absence of these elements,
it is all the time drawing nearer extinction,
or it may at least become gradually
less capable of maintaining its own sex—which
is feminine. At least, it appears, before
it is overtaken by the total extinction
which threatens it if it is not fertilized, to
lose the energy necessary, when fertilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ensues, to maintain its sex, and so may become
fitted to assume the opposite masculine
sex. This much, however, seems to be quite
certain, according to Mayerhofer, that the
human ovary does not contain male and female
ova already possessed of sex. Equally
impossible is it to imagine male and female
seminal filaments (spermatozoa) already existing
in the organism, and provided with distinct
capacities for generating definite sexes.
We are unacquainted with any special anatomical
signs indicating any such distinction,
and do not, even after microscopic investigation,
find ourselves prompted to assume the
existence of such distinct forms as would
allow us to conclude the existence of so fundamental
a difference. It is true that in
many of the lower animals different forms of
spermatozoa are known. These are developed
in one and the same testicle, and under the
microscope whisk about confusedly with vivacious
movements. We find this in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of a kind of snail (<i>Murex brandaris</i>). If we
observe a drop of the semen of this creature
diluted with sea water, the greater number
of the spermatozoa, possessing head, central
portion, and tail, move about very energetically.
Amongst them are other spermatozoa,
distinctly larger and of different form, whose
shape suggests spindle-like elements, ending
in thin thread-like tails. All these objects
exhibit a striking vivacity of movement.
Whether these objects represent a particular
kind of spermatozoa (as some have supposed),
exhibiting definite sexual character, or whether
they are not cells, striking on account of their
movements, out of which spermatozoa are
developed (the so-called spermatides or spermatogonia,
transition forms out of which spermatozoa
are developed), is at present an open
question.</p>

<p>H. A. Pagenstecher attempted an important
readjustment of Thury’s theory, and tried to
show that it might be made concordant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
what had been elucidated by previous observations.
He holds fast to the axiom (Joh.
Muller, Home, Geoffrey St. Hilaire, etc.), that
the embryo is at first sexless, and that the
ovum after its fertilization still has this character,
and must possess the potentiality of
developing its sex in two different directions.
The factors which determine sex must be
external to the embryo.</p>

<p>Pagenstecher remarks that the relations
which have existed anterior to the fertilization
of the ovum, as well as its age (with which
its ripeness is connected), are from the outset
without influence on sex.</p>

<p>The embryonal germ, before its fertilization,
is an embryo whose sexual development
is undetermined. In this case fertilization
acts as an external factor in the direction of
determining the sexual quality of this indeterminate
embryo.</p>

<p>The act of impregnation would be of influence
upon the sex of the embryo in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with the character of the father. That
follows from Pagenstecher’s explanations of
Hofacker’s observations. According to Hofacker
we get from men of twenty-four years
of age and upwards, as also from sheep of a
certain age, an average of a greater number
of males. In the case of mothers, also, as we
have already pointed out, the sexually-stronger
age (Lenkart, Girou de Buzareingues, Hofacker,
Morel de Vindé, Sadler) and the food
have an influence upon the majority of births
of female individuals. Here should be added
the experience of Nasse and Van den Bosch.
The observations of Dzierzon, von Siebold,
Lenkart, and von Berlepsh, on the development
of sex in bees, and, according to von
Siebold, among the Psychids, should also be
taken into consideration. When the females
of certain Psychids are not impregnated they
lay only female ova. If they are impregnated,
male ova appear also. The tree-lice
(Cestoni, Réaumur) give birth to living young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
without impregnation. These are at first only
female, <i>afterwards males appear as well</i>.
After this impregnation commences, and the
females begin to lay ova.</p>

<p>The experiments of Knight, who found
that melons and cucumbers produce male
blossoms under higher temperature and female
under lower (which was verified by
Mauz), demonstrate that, in this case, such
external factors as warmth, light, dryness,
have an influence upon sex. Pagenstecher,
however, believes that the conditions of origin
of sex are not the same in animals and plants.
We must not, he says, from these observations
draw conclusions off-hand respecting the
sexual propagation of plants nor of animals
in general.</p>

<p>It must be further pointed out with regard
to the thesis that ova which are emitted last
have had more time to ripen, that we must
reflect whether the process of ripening may
not have also begun late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Thury’s observation that the last egg laid
by a singing bird developed a male (communicated
by O. Bourrit), and that in the case
of hens the majority of the later eggs were
males, seemed to Pagenstecher not quite certain.
He mentions also a method by which,
in poultry breeding, the breeding experiments
can be conducted on a regular principle,
which I shall quote word for word:—</p>

<p>“For this experiment a number of hens are
taken which may be anticipated to be “setters,”
unless the use of incubators is preferred.
The hens are to be separated, and the eggs
which each one lays in her own particular
nest are to be marked with numbers corresponding
to the days on which they were laid.</p>

<p>“The eggs of the different hens are now to
be rearranged, so that the eggs which each
particular hen is given to hatch shall, as
nearly as possible, have the same numbers.
For example, if the number of the hens be
six, and the period of laying up to the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
when the hens begin to set be thirty days,
one hen will have eggs to hatch with the
numbers 1 to 5, the next 6 to 10, the third
11 to 15, the fourth 16 to 20, the fifth 21 to
25, the sixth 26 to 30.</p>

<p>“In this way the doubt will be avoided,
which necessarily arises, if I give the eggs of
one hen, although marked, to be hatched by
her alone.</p>

<p>“In the latter case, it can very seldom be
known with certainty from which egg-shell a
cock or hen issued.</p>

<p>“In this experiment, on the contrary, one
can quietly wait until the cocks and hens in
the growing broods of the different hens can
be clearly distinguished and numbered, seeing
that each brood has numbers (of the days
of laying) of very nearly the same value.
The experiment is easier and less subject to
the possibility of error when the eggs belong
to different varieties and are taken from
known parents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Fertilization in many cases alters the future
sex as soon as it affects the germ in some
corresponding manner. The germ develops
itself, and, in the case of creatures whose
ova develop without fertilization, evolves one,
or the other, or both of the sexes. According
to Pagenstecher, fertilization often alters
the determination of the sex of the germs
which attain to development in the ova.
The point of time in the life of an ovum, at
which it has reached that degree of ripeness
which gives it such a character that the
semen can no longer affect the determination
of the sex, cannot be absolutely settled. A
more powerful bull might beget female calves
earlier in the late rutting time than an older
one.</p>

<p>After further explanations and critical expositions,
which suggest themselves in the
course of the examination of the theory, Pagenstecher
lays stress upon the following
important dicta of Thury’s teaching:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Sex depends upon the ripeness of the
ovum at the time of fertilization.</p>

<p>2. The ovum which, at the moment of fertilization,
has not yet reached a certain degree
of ripeness, produces a female. If this
degree of ripeness has been passed, the ovum,
upon fertilization, produces a male.</p>

<p>3. If at the time of rutting a single ovum
is detached from the ovary, and descends
slowly through the genital canal (animals
which bear a single offspring), fertilization
taking place at the beginning of the rutting
suffices to produce a female, and at the end
of the rutting to produce a male, provided
that the change in the condition of the ovum
takes place normally during its passage
through the genital canal.</p>

<p>Both the theory as Thury stated it, and the
critical remarks that have been made upon
it, have been further elucidated in many subsequent
works. Here Pictet, Chavannes, C.
Vogt, De Philippi, and others, have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
part. Pictet believes in the uniformity of
the sexual life of vegetables and animals, so
that both would be subject to identical fundamental
laws.</p>

<p>The facts which stand in certain relations
with the fundamental laws are numerous, and
the manner in which they tend to affect those
fundamental laws occasions various combinations
in the variety of phenomena.</p>

<p>For the animal kingdom Thury adduces a
number of observations as the foundation of
his teaching. We shall here turn our attention
to some of them.</p>

<p>We have already pointed out that in the
case of the eggs of the singing birds, which
are laid by turns, the young which emerges
from the last strikingly smaller egg, the so-called
“nest egg,” is always a male.</p>

<p>According to the theory of Thury, the
ripeness of the ovum depends also upon the
place which, in the animals, it occupies in
the ovary. In consequence, according to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
author, it is not improbable that we shall find
an irregularity in the successive production
of male and female ova.</p>

<p>If the activity of the generative apparatus
of the female should be increased by any
circumstance, in the case of the animals the
ripening of the ovum would be accelerated.
The consequence would be an earlier detachment
or emptying out of the ova from the
ovary. In consequence, the generative operations
in the animal are of a more complex
nature than in plants, a fact which is of
great significance for the determination of sex.</p>

<p>The continuous intercourse of the male
with the female increases the capacity for
accelerating the ripening of the ovum. According
to Burdach the mother animals who
do not have frequent intercourse with the
male bear more females, because their ova do
not, before fertilization, attain so high a degree
of ripeness as to be able to develop into
males. Also, it appears from observations on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
animals, not to be improbable that the male
chooses the time of intercourse. The determination
of the chosen time depends upon
many influences. The causes of choice may
be sought in many factors. Some of these
depend upon external influences; others have
internal causes. The causes may be general
or personal. They may depend upon external
form, or be occasioned by other phenomena
of the animal world. It is always easy for
these phenomena, which in their nature are
of the most different kinds, to escape observation.</p>

<p>Amongst cattle and sheep the first-born are
more often females. (Girou.) Also in the human
species a greater number of females are
observed amongst the first-born. Here, on
the one hand, regular intercourse with the
male is to some extent unfamiliar; whilst, also,
according to Thury, the choice of the date of
marriage might be of importance. The constancy
of the births may be explained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
regularity of the intercourse of the two parents
in consequence of the reciprocal ties
which surround family life.</p>

<p>From illegitimate births more girls result
than from marriage. The reason of this
might be sought in the influence of the active
excitement of the female at the time at which
the conception took place, that is, shortly after
menstruation, when the woman is most easily
excitable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The various theories respecting the explanation
of the production of sex which are known
to us, from the earliest accounts down to the
modern predominance of natural philosophy,
have been collected by W. His. (‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv für
Anthropologie</i>,’ Band 4, 5.)</p>

<p>Since then, it is true, during the course of
successive studies, and more especially of
those which have been made during the present
century, many substantial alterations have
appeared in the views held respecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
cause of the different development of sex.
We have seen this above.</p>

<p>Thus, discoveries have been made which
have exercised a very wide influence, for
example, that of the ovum in man and in
the other mammalia (Baer, 1828), or the
penetration of the spermatozoa into the protoplasm
of the ovum as a necessary condition
of fertilization. In later times it has been
made certain that the head of the spermatozoon
is a nucleus, and that only one spermatozoon
penetrates into the interior of the
ovum. Afterwards its head as a nucleus
unites with a nucleus-part of the ovum,
forming a new nucleus in the ovule, which,
together with the surrounding protoplasm,
serves as the point of departure of the further
processes of development, and in this
condition is described as an oosperm. After
this follow other extensive details of the
process of development, which will not be
described here. It may be already seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from the few principal factors of the process
mentioned, that our theory respecting the development
of the sex in the embryo will
have to be substantially altered. We shall
here adduce only the fundamental doctrines
respecting the development of the generative
organs laid down by Waldeyer in his masterly
work on the ovary and the ovum. The
teaching for which we are indebted to His,
Kölliker, Schäfer-Korschelt, Heider, Duval,
Kollmann, Minot, Bonnet, Bergh, Prénant,
Balfour, Romiti, Kuppfer, and others, must
also be well remembered, as well as the acquisitions
of new information connected with
the physiology of the embryo, and, of quite
recent date, the mechanism of development
(Roux), which can acquaint us more especially
with the particulars respecting the
states and processes in the ovule during the
earliest life-stages of its development.</p>

<p>The doctrines of the physiology of metabolism
in men and beasts under different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
circumstances have exercised so powerful an
influence over our comprehension of the relations
of the individual during the sexual-life,
that we practically find in all these teachings
a powerful support, whence we may obtain
many elucidations bearing upon the question
lying before us, and may discover the principles
necessary to complete our theory.</p>

<p>But, before entering upon the fundamental
principles of the theory which I have set
forth, I wish to mention a treatise of Mayrhofer’s,
the principal results of which I
shall briefly recapitulate. After that I shall
mention briefly such information as I have
met with respecting the nutrition of the
mother.</p>

<p>Mayrhofer was led by critical notices and
the observations of others, and, further, by his
own experiences, to conclusions which he set
forth in propositions, some of which I select
here.</p>

<p>In the plants and the lower animals food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
plays a principal part in the development of
sex. The sex is not generated, but depends
upon external influences over the fruit which
is in a state of development. And here we
have a stage which precedes the separate sex
in man, in which stage sexual neutrality must
be regarded as normal, where also we find a
kind of hermaphroditism.</p>

<p>Whether sex in the human species is determined
at conception, or only develops itself
afterwards, we must attempt to discover from
obstetric experience.</p>

<p>The twins and triplets contained by one
chorion are of the same sex, and have a common
placenta in which the blood passages of
both umbilical cords communicate with one
another. On this account, also, many opine
that the identity of sex is occasioned by the
intermixture of the blood, an opinion regarded,
on the contrary, by others, with incredulity,
because the intermixture of the blood might
very possibly lead merely to a mixture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
not to homogeneity, under which circumstances
dissimilarity of development would be
possible enough. We may here adduce the
following facts also (Jhering): The armadilloes
produce a number of young in one litter,
which are normally developed in a single
chorion, and are of the same sex, as in the
case with man when twins are developed in
one chorion.</p>

<p>Heartless monstrosities (<i>Acardiaci</i>) are, in
spite of imperfect nutrition (the conditions of
proper nutrition by the blood are wanting in
the embryo), of the same sex as normal offspring.
Now, cases of this kind demonstrate
that, in the later periods of development,
although the conditions of nutrition are not
alike, nevertheless the similarity of sex in the
twins is maintained; so the foundation of the
future sex would be laid at the period of
conception. This rule which proves valid for
the twins found in a single chorion, would
apply for all human ova in general, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
all possess the capacity of attaining their sexual
character at conception.</p>

<p>According to Mayrhofer, placentæ are rare
in which, where there are two chorions, communication
is found between the vessels of
the two umbilical cords. In addition to what
has been already mentioned, Mayrhofer lays
down the law, which we find frequently
stated in many quarters, that the older of
the two parents has a greater preponderance
in favor of the propagation of his, or her,
sex. Especially the physical maturity on the
man’s side enables him to propagate his own
sex, either in connection with younger or
older women. A superiority on the part of
the woman produces girls.</p>

<p>Our author only partly supports Thury’s
theory, and considers it an open question
whether the time of impregnation has any
influence on the origin of sex. But he lays
down this principle, that an economy of
the semen by infrequent indulgence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
intercourse is extremely favorable to the production
of males.</p>

<p>It may be possible to obtain more exact
data respecting the origin of sex from the
artificial breeding of fish. In this case the
properties of the sperm, as well as of the ova,
might be observed at an earlier date by means
of a fertilization effected externally. Attention
might be also paid to the age of the
parents. In short, all the factors of artificial
influence upon the development of sex can
in this case be taken in hand and controlled
by varying the process of artificial fertilization.
The author does not appear to know
that the results obtained by artificial breeding
differ remarkably from those which are the
consequence of the natural multiplication of
fish, nor that the development of sex is unfavorably
affected in many ways. The cause
of that lies very likely in the nutrition of the
young fry, and perhaps, also, partly in cross-breeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>What influence the physical welfare of the
parents, and especially of the mother, has on
the sex of the offspring in man, besides other
factors deserving of attention, ought to be
discoverable from the statistics of the lying-in
hospitals. This is, in my opinion, hardly to
be expected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On various occasions, whilst taking into
consideration the possibility of an influence
on the part of the parents over the sex of
the child (in such respects as have been placed
before us in the literature dealing with this
subject), we often had occasion to direct attention
to the food of the parents. And especially
the food of the mother seemed to us to
be of the highest importance.</p>

<p>Now, it is universally known that metabolism
is increased during pregnancy. The
products of excretion in the case of pregnant
women are much smaller than the quantity
of matter taken in, in the shape of food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
The difference, to a great extent, represents
the matter taken to form the bodily substance
of the embryo, in accordance with the anterior
laws which have been fixed by the doctrines
of the physiology of metabolism. It
will, then, be necessary to pay particular attention
to the investigation of metabolism.
Suggestions are not wanting. They will be
found amongst the observations of leading
specialists. For example, Winckel observed
that during pregnancy the temperature was
slightly raised. This increase of temperature
must practically be explained as due to the
higher and more productive process of oxidization,
which has to be accomplished by the
human female for the sake of nourishing the
fœtus.</p>

<p>During pregnancy the number of blood
corpuscles suffers an observable diminution.
Still plainer is the reduction of the quantity
of hæmoglobin, when measured with Fleischl’s
hæmatometer. This last phenomenon is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
likely connected with a greater consumption
of hæmoglobin, the substance being used up
by oxidization.</p>

<p>Observations of setting hens are not without
interest. In their case, also, a diminution
of hæmoglobin is observable during the period
of incubation. The hæmoglobin can sink
to nearly 50 per cent. of the normal amount.
With the increase of hæmoglobin in the embryo
and its simultaneous diminution in the
mother during incubation, it happens, at a
certain period in the process of development,
that the embryo in the egg and the setting
hen possess a nearly equal measure of hæmoglobin
with a nearly equal number of blood
corpuscles. An increase of the quantity of
hæmoglobin until the normal amount is
reached may be observed in both towards
the end of incubation.</p>

<p>The Rhine salmon each year go up in a
well-nourished condition from the sea into
the fresh-water streams to spawn. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
they remain several months. They lose much
of their muscular substance. (Miescher.) On
the other hand, a great development of the
sexual organs and of sexual secretions takes
place, produced, probably, at the expense of
the used-up muscular substance.</p>

<p>Many have paid particular attention to the
nourishment of the maternal organism. Investigations
have also been published dealing
with the nutrition of the parent animals in
cases when it was desired to exercise an influence
over the sex.</p>

<p>In fact, we have frequently touched upon
such subjects, although only lightly. Here,
as we are about to proceed to the subjects of
nutrition and metabolism in the human female
awaiting impregnation, we find ourselves
compelled to acquaint the reader with a number
of facts which permit us to assume a
connection between the food supply (including
metabolism) and the development of sex.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>


<p>According to St. Hilaire, the male sex is
more common in the case of scantily nourished
(and therefore weakly) animals. Giron de
Buzareingues says that the same is sometimes
the case with domesticated mammalia. Martegoute
has found that the sheep which bear
female offspring are, on the average, of a
heavier weight. Furriers have remarked that
in fruitful regions more furs of female animals
are always to be had than in unfruitful
districts. It would follow from this that better
nourishment assists the production of
females.</p>

<p>This observation seems, however, to be concordant
with the general practice of farmers,
according to which it is usual to keep a
greater number of the females of the domesticated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
animals, on account of their utility.
The males are kept only in such numbers as
may be absolutely necessary for breeding purposes,
or for stronger beasts of burden. The
surplus is, by means of trade, disposed of in
other regions. In consequence, in poor unfruitful
districts, the number of males is
pretty nearly the same as in fruitful regions,
the actual requisite number being in both
cases about the same. The females, on the
contrary, can be much better kept in fruitful
districts, where there are rich and fertile
meadows and better fodder, than in the poor
regions. In the latter the females are consequently
rarer.</p>

<p>Wilkens attempted to apply diet to the production
of sex in the domesticated mammalia,
and laid down the following principles: The
food must be of influence upon the embryo
in the mother’s womb, and the better nourishment
favors the female, the worse the male
sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already mentioned the views of
Robin and Born respecting the influence of
food.</p>

<p>Düsing turned his attention to the effect of
diet upon horses, with a view to the development
of sex.</p>

<p>The state of nutrition of the parents
would have an influence upon the development
of the embryo. In this case, also, the
better condition produced females, the worse
males.</p>

<p>According to Düsing, if the mother was
well nourished, old semen operating upon a
young ovum would produce a majority of
female offspring. On the other hand, if the
mother was insufficiently fed, young semen
operating upon an old ovum would produce a
majority of male individuals.</p>

<p>According to Wappaens, richer or poorer
nourishment in years of different fruitfulness
in Sweden has no effect upon the prevalence
of one or the other sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Ploss also tried to draw attention to the
fact that better food, in the case of the male
as well as of the female parent, could have
some effect. Thus, a balance of the numbers
of the two sexes depended upon the better
or worse harvests in different regions. If an
excess of one sex appeared in one year, in
consequence of an abundance of food, in the
next year unfavorable circumstances raised
the number of the other sex, and thus a proportion
was reached which represented the
normal numbers.</p>

<p>According to Fiquet, female calves are
born if the cow is poorly fed. This diet
should last some weeks, but the bull should
be abundantly fed before serving.</p>

<p>According to Landois, food plays a most
important part in the determination of sex
amongst insects. If the germ be richly
nourished, females are principally developed.
(Landois, ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Physiologie</i>.’)</p>

<p>A great number of different foods and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
drinks, and also substances which have direct
medical effects, are commonly known or held
to exercise an effect upon the activity of the
generative organs, and of these some are also
recommended under medical advice.</p>

<p>Many of the medicinal substances should
be carefully avoided. The use of them may
prove deleterious. Cantharides, or various
preparations of them, as well as other substances
enumerated under this head in pharmacology,
are distinctly to be eschewed. Not
only are they absolutely incapable of exercising
any influence over the sex of the future
offspring, but they can also be distinctly injurious
to the whole organism, or in any case
to the urinary and generative organs in this
way, that, after having produced their effect,
they occasion a reaction, which leads to abnormal
conditions and inflammation of the
kidneys. No expedient of this kind, no food
of any sort, nor drink, should ever be used,
without medical advice. Most of all are these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
expedients out of place where any question
exists of determining the sex of offspring.</p>

<p>All these nostrums, as well as the particular
kinds of food or drink, exercise only temporarily
a certain influence over the activity
of the sexual organs, exactly as they do in
general over the nervous condition, the mental
disposition, humor, etc., which are temporarily
stimulated.</p>

<p>Herewith may be classed the expedient of
the injection of semen recommended by Brown-Sequard,
in consequence of which people of
advanced age enjoy a feeling of rejuvenescence.
His first experiment was tried upon
himself, and, in spite of his advanced age, he
felt himself quite fresh and young. Originally
the injection consisted of a sort of watery
extract made from the testicles of animals.
Afterwards preparations were used which had
been more carefully prepared. These extracts
are employed by medical men under the name
of spermin or orchidin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>In a similar way an attempt was made to
obtain extracts and pure preparations from
the ovaries of animals (oophorin), which were
to be used in the same manner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After having given ourselves the trouble to
glance through the long series of different
views which have existed concerning the origin
of sex, we are struck with the fact, that
scarcely a single objective observation has
been made that could lead to a positive result
in the development of sex in the new-born.
Out of all these theories, however, one
hypothesis does seem to be tenable, and to
that we shall find ourselves compelled to give
our adhesion here, after having set forth the
detailed explanations which shall presently follow.
Now, we were not led to the recognition
of the truth of this teaching by previously
assumed theories. On the contrary, it
was after we had completed our experiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and had been led by them to positive results,
that we found ourselves compelled, in order
to find an explanation of the whole process,
to fall back upon the theory of cross-heredity
of sex, and to place it, by our own experience,
upon firmer foundations. It must be
briefly remarked here that the literature of
this subject is very extensive, and to trace
out all the literary results would lead us too
far. For which reason I have limited myself
to the actual facts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In order to enter more fully into our theory,
it will in the first place be necessary to turn
our attention to the products of excretion
which are eliminated from the bodies of animals,
in a more or less solid, fluid, or gaseous
form, as the results of the transformations of
matter which have taken place in the bodies
of the animals. The chemical constituents of
the evacuations are either such as it has not
been possible to convert to use in the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
or such as are evacuated as the final product
of the oxidation which has been effected in
the body by the process of combustion.</p>

<p>Of these the former are evacuated from the
body as so much inert matter which has not
been affected by the digestive juice, nor altered
in any other way. The latter are given
off from the animal’s body in various states
of oxidation in the urine, sweat, or dung, or
else in a gaseous form by the lungs.</p>

<p>A great number of the substances which
have been hitherto exactly examined are secreted
by the kidneys and appear in the urine.
In this fluid are found nitrogenous products
of secretion, others free from nitrogen, and
inorganic substances.</p>

<p>Amongst the substances free from nitrogen,
I found myself prompted <i>more particularly to
select as an object of my attention the carbo-hydrate
(sugar) found in the urine</i>. Three
groups of closely connected compounds are
reckoned amongst the carbo-hydrates. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
which contain in the molecule six, or a multiple
of six, atoms of carbon. The hydrogen
and oxygen are in the same proportion as in
water. (Arnold.)</p>

<p>The three groups are grape-sugar, cane
sugar, and cellulose. In the urine grape-sugar
occurs normally among the products of excretion
in inconsiderable quantities. Under exceptional
circumstances, in cases of polyuria,
inosite can occur. (H. Voll, Neumeister.) In addition
we find also a carbo-hydrate mentioned
by E. Luther that would be of the character
of dextrine, and probably owes its existence to
the secretive activity of the urinary bladder.</p>

<p>Upon boiling the urine with mineral acids
we obtain substances which separate as brown
flakes. We denote these “humin-substances”
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Huminsubstanzen</i>, Udránsky, Salkowski). In
addition to these must be enumerated animal
gum, isomaltose, pentaglycoses, lævo-rotary
sugar, the conjugate glycuronic acids, etc. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
conclusion, the occurrence of milk-sugar must
be mentioned, which appears in the last days
of pregnancy. The last-mentioned substances
occur in very insignificant quantities, and are
not to be enumerated among the ordinary
constituent parts of the urine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The carbo-hydrates may be, in many respects,
of high interest for the activity of the
organism in its metabolism, as they are found
amongst the products of excretion only as
final products of the completed transformation
and using-up of the food.</p>

<p>The excretion of a carbo-hydrate in the
urine can be interpreted to mean that the
process of combustion in the organism in
question has not been complete. By some
agencies, at present unknown to us, the efficiency
of the organism becomes impaired in
such a way that it does not fully use up all
combustible substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of substances can be excreted
from the body which are capable of a further
process of oxidation—for example, until they
are oxidized into carbonic acid and water.
The heat which could be hereby generated is
withdrawn from the organism, and must be
procured by fresh nourishment, in order to
replace that which has been lost by an imperfect
assimilation of the food.</p>

<p>One substance which occurs in the urine,
about which much has been written by various
authors, by physiologists, by medical men,
and by chemists, is of high importance for
our inquiry. That is the <i>sugar found in normal
urine</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When this substance occurs in the human
organism, no matter in how small a quantity,
its presence always suggests the assumption
that it ought not to have been secreted in the
form of grape-sugar. For, if the organism
possessed its full efficiency to deal with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
necessary quantity of food taken, then one
might also suppose that a substance such as
grape-sugar, be the quantity never so small,
would not be secreted in an unaltered form,
but must be further used up, seeing that the
sugar would be decomposed, oxidized, in short,
burnt up.</p>

<p>The imperfect performance of an operation
of this kind by the organism is not to be
taken for a symptom of pathological processes.
In point of fact, it has been impossible to
recognize, in the case of individuals afflicted
with this imperfection, any symptoms of processes
of such a character as would furnish
the remotest occasion for the appearance of
disease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When small quantities of saccharine matter
are excreted, derived from carbo-hydrates
which have been swallowed, or, on the other
hand, formed within the human body, say
from albuminous principles, it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
expected that this excretion, occurring repeatedly
in different individuals, ought to be
regarded as a normal metabolic process. Such
an occurrence must be interpreted, in fact,
in much the same way as other small anomalies
which affect the organism, whose presence
leads to no further consequences.</p>

<p>But our attention must be directed, not to
the sugar alone, but to a number of other
so-called reducing substances, because these,
as regards certain reactions, resemble grape-sugar,
and have to be distinguished from it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the year 1858 my highly-revered master,
E. Brücke, drew attention to the presence
of grape-sugar in normal urine. The
foundation of the theory of normal glycosuria
was laid by his obtaining the potassium compound
of sugar (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zuckerkali</i>) from large quantities
of urine. His theory has been since
much elaborated, and a great deal written
both for and against it. When this symptom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in the urine reaches a certain proportion per
cent., the condition of the individual must be
described as diseased.</p>

<p>If we apply qualitative chemical tests for
sugar, we soon find that they are disturbed
by a number of reducing substances which
exist in the urine, and it is often difficult to
determine whether the processes used to discover
the sugar do not produce more reducing
substances than the sugar itself.</p>

<p>Bence-Jones agrees with Brücke’s opinion
respecting the presence of sugar in normal
urine, and insists upon its power to rotate
the plane of polarization to the right. More
recent authors, Ivanof, Huizinga, Pavy, Abeles,
have stated this fact in different ways,
and it yet remains to be verified. The fact
existed, but not without meeting with contradiction.
Maly, Seegen, Friedländer, and
many others sought to oppose the view.</p>

<p>Although in many cases with the commonly
used reactions it is impossible to demonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the presence of sugar in samples of urine,
nevertheless, the sugar has been isolated in
considerable quantities, by means of precipitation
with acetate of lead and ammonia, and
by subsequent decomposition of the precipitate
with sulphuretted hydrogen (E. Ludwig),
after which it has been successfully tested
and recognized by characteristic reactions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We shall here concern ourselves principally
with the appearance or the increase of the
sugar, so far as its presence according to the
views hitherto held is normal.</p>

<p>We are acquainted with a so-called alimentary
glycosuria, which is occasioned by this,
that the individual in question, after having
eaten an excessive quantity of sugar, easily
recognizes an increase of the quantity of
sugar in the urine. But there are also individuals,
who, though they may have eaten a
very large quantity of sugar, cannot afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
discover a trace of it in the urine. In these
cases complete combustion has taken place.</p>

<p>But here we must also next direct our attention
to the fact that there are persons
who, in the digestion of their food under all
circumstances, excrete sugar, though perhaps
in very small quantities. Others, after eating
proportionately much larger quantities, excrete
no perceptible sugar in the urine.
Hoppe-Seyler, after having eaten 225 grammes
of sugar, could find no trace of it in his
urine. (Moritz.) Frerichs admits exceptions,
and relates that in the case of two men he
could always discover sugar in the urine
after they had eaten sugar, although he considered
both healthy. Then we find specialists
like Budge, C. Schmidt, Mosler, Schiff,
Vogel, C. Ludwig, Voit, etc., who admit, after
their experiments with men and beasts, an
artificial glycosuria, which is normal. Seegen,
after feeding dogs with cane sugar, found inverted
sugar (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">invertzucker</i>) in the urine. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sugar which he was able to identify was of
two kinds, one of them turning the polarization
plane to the right, and the other turning
it to the left.</p>

<p>Experiments with champagnes, various
other wines and sweetmeats, which contain
great quantities of sugar, gave as a regular
result perceptible sugar in the urine of many
individuals. As a consequence of greater
quantities being taken, an excessive glycosuria
set in. Its duration depended upon the occasioning
causes alone. On their removal,
the quantity of sugar either returned to a
minimum or entirely disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The presence of sugar in normal human
urine is therefore possibly in accordance with
all the above-mentioned observations. This
fact must be considered a physiological axiom
as regards the constituents of normal urine.
The quantity of sugar contained can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
increased by a condition of alimentary glycosuria.
But, when there is no such artificial
cause, and yet the sugar is recognizable,
without the ordinary régime of life being
altered, still its presence is no symptom of
a pathological process going on. Even the
continuation of the insignificant excretion
of sugar, when it continues for many years,
appears to exercise no influence over the
health. <i>But as one finds many individuals in
whose urine not even the minimum quantity
of sugar is discoverable, it seems not improbable
that in a perfectly normal condition of
the organism it is possible for many individuals
completely to burn up the whole of the carbo-hydrates
either taken into the organism or
formed within it.</i> Such persons, in consequence
of their metabolism being normal,
are able to carry out the process of combustion
to the full, and their excretions are of
such a nature as should represent the normal
processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>But, if this condition of the excretions cannot
be attained in a given individual in the
desired degree, the organism is suffering from
an imperfection that occurs in a normal manner
(an excretion of sugar) to a certain degree
and extent, such as the physiological
potentialities of a living organism permit.</p>

<p>In one connection only, in which it afforded
me practical assistance for my observations,
this question has not yet been fully elucidated.
Sex had not been taken into consideration
during the examination of the
excretion of sugar within normal physiological
bounds. Whilst I was looking through
the experiments of the specialists whom I
have mentioned, it struck me that most of
the inquiries respecting the presence of sugar
in normal urine had been made in the case
of men alone, and that, so far as regarded
the presence of sugar, the urine of the human
female had been little observed, and
never quantitatively and qualitatively compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with that of man. Nicolai Ivanoff,
in his dissertation (Dorpat) on the question
of glycosuria in the case of pregnant women,
lying-in women, and suckling women, arrived
at the following final results: “A physiological
glycosuria in the case of the pregnant, or
of those who are lying in, has, so far as
present investigations have gone, never been
established, and certainly not to the extent
which Blot asserts. Sugar occurs in human
urine more frequently than has been hitherto
supposed, but absolutely never <i>in constant
and increased quantities in that of pregnant
and lying-in women</i>.”</p>

<p>If, however, it has been in many cases
asserted that there was an increased quantity
of sugar in the urine of pregnant and lying-in
women, and that this has been proved,
these statements have originated from mistaking
for a previously developed sugar one
which has during the experiments come into
existence from the action of alkalies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
acids on an extractive substance which requires
further examination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the detection of sugar in the urine
several methods exist, which are more or less
sensitive.</p>

<p>If we mix a few cubic centimetres of urine
with an equal quantity of 10 per cent. solution
of caustic potash, and warm a portion of
this in a test-tube, we observe that the fluid
in the event of a sensible quantity of sugar
being present, acquires a color varying from
dark yellow to yellowish brown. We can
most easily assure ourselves of this if we
warm only the upper part of the fluid contained
in the test-tube, whereupon the upper
part of the fluid will appear darker than the
rest.</p>

<p>This test will give a distinct result only in
presence of a minimum of 1 per cent. of
sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>A much more sensitive test consists in the
reduction of a salt of bismuth in an alkaline
solution of urine sugar. This test, given by
Böttcher, was modified in the following
manner by Nylander. Four grammes of
Seignette salts are dissolved in 100 cubic
centimetres of soda lye of the sp. gr. 1.119,
and 2 grammes of bismuth subnitrite are
added to the fluid warmed in a water-bath.
This solution represents Nylander’s
reagent.</p>

<p>In order to use the test we mix five cubic
centimetres of the urine to be examined
(which, if possible, ought not to have a specific
gravity higher than 1.020) with 0.5 cubic
centimetre of Nylander’s reagent in a test-tube.
The mixture is now boiled for two
minutes. If more than 0.5 per cent. of sugar
is present in the urine, the originally white
precipitate of earthy phosphates becomes deep
black; with 0.05 per cent. of sugar it shows
a clear, brown color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>If this test is not the most sensitive of all,
it provides us with a process for recognizing
sugar in the urine, and not a number
of other reducing substances mixed with it.
(Neumeister.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amongst the various tests for sugar used
in practice, that of Trommer is one of the
most common.</p>

<p>We mix some 5 cubic centimetres of urine
with an equal volume of 10 per cent. solution
of potash or soda, and add to the mixture,
drop by drop, a 10 per cent. solution of sulphate
of copper, so long as the resulting
hydrated oxide of copper is dissolved by the
sugar.</p>

<p>In this way we get, according to the quantity
of sugar contained, a more or less ultramarine-blue
fluid. If we warm this, the
result, in consequence of the reducing action,
is a reddish-yellow precipitate of hydrated
suboxide of copper which, after a short time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
adheres to the sides of the test-tube, somewhat
in the fashion of a mirror.</p>

<p>This test can be applied fairly simply, and
it gives good results in presence of more than
0.5 per cent. of sugar. But at the same time
we cannot use it to detect extremely minute
quantities of sugar such as normally occur in
human urine, because the urine, as we have
already remarked, contains a number of substances
which reduce alkaline solutions of
copper.</p>

<p>The effect of these substances is sometimes
such as to produce the illusion that from 0.3
to 0.5 per cent. of saccharine matter is present.
(Neumeister.)</p>

<p>In recent times, for qualitative and quantitative
investigation of the grape-sugar, much
use has been made of graduated fermentation-tubes.</p>

<p>For this experiment we mix about 10 cubic
centimetres of urine with a small quantity
of yeast of ascertained weight, and fill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fermentation-tube with the mixture. After
the lapse of twenty-four hours, during which
the whole is kept in an incubator at a temperature
of 30° centigrade, all the grape-sugar
will be completely fermented.</p>

<p>From the gaseous fermentation-products of
the grape-sugar, which rise into the longer
branch of the U-tube, and consist of carbonic
acid, we detect the presence of sugar in the
urine.</p>

<p>By means of the graduation of the longer
branch, we can at once read off the percentage
of the sugar. This test is sensitive
enough to detect 0.05 per cent. of sugar. It
is useful first of all to boil the urine to be
tested, in order to remove from it the carbonic
acid contained in solution. It is also
advantageous to acidify the urine, so that the
yeast fungus which flourishes more easily in
the acid medium may overpower any gas-producing
bacteria, and so avoid a false result.</p>

<p>In 1884, E. Fischer discovered phenylhydrazin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and pointed out the fact that it might
be used as a valuable reagent for the sugar
in urine.</p>

<p>This preparation has the characteristic peculiarity
of forming crystalline compounds
with aldehydes and ketones. These crystals,
in the cases of the different kinds of sugar,
which, as is known, represent the aldehydes
and ketones, respectively, are needle-shaped,
of a yellow color, with difficulty soluble in
water, have a high melting-point, and are
called glycosazone.</p>

<p>Jaksch used this property of phenylhydrazin
for his phenylhydrazin test. For this experiment
he dilutes the urine with an equal quantity
of distilled water in a test-tube, and adds
twice as much phenylhydrazin hydrochloride
as can be taken up on the end of a knife,
and double that quantity of sodium acetate.
The mixture is well shaken together and left
from half an hour to an hour in a boiling
water-bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, if the test-tube and its contents be
slowly cooled, at the end of about twelve
hours the sediment is found to consist partly
of spherical resinous lumps, and partly of
microscopical tuft-shaped crystals.</p>

<p>These crystals are nothing else than glycosazone-compounds.
(Moritz.) In normal
urine this reaction is very often observed as
distinctly evident as if we had to do with a
urine containing as much as 1 to 2 per cent.
of sugar.</p>

<p>In reality besides the extremely minute
traces of grape-sugar, a whole number of
aldehydes and ketones are present in urine,
which can form phenylazone.</p>

<p>Amidst all these substances those which,
according to the investigations of Flückiger
chiefly interfere with these tests are the
glycuronic acid compounds, as they give
crystals of the same form in the course of
the reaction. Flückiger detected these compounds
by their property of rotating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
polarization-plane to the left, and reducing
alkaline solutions of copper after long boiling.
More accurate investigations enabled
him to identify these substances with acetone
compounds.</p>

<p>Moritz recommends the following method
of discovering whether we have to deal with
grape-sugar, glycuronic acid compounds, or
other (azone) crystal-forming substances.</p>

<p>Several litres of normal urine are precipitated
with lead chloride and filtered; the filtrate
is precipitated with ammonia and again
filtered; the residue on the filter is washed
and then dried on a clay slab. It is after
this decomposed with oxalic acid, mixed with
acetate of lead in excess, and the filtrate is
deprived of its lead by hydrosulphuric acid.
As a result is obtained a perfectly clear fluid
to which the phenylhydrazin test described
above is applied.</p>

<p>The precipitate obtained is filtered off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
repeatedly washed with chloroform and alcohol,
several times crystallized, and finally the
melting-point of the needle-shaped crystals,
which can be seen with the naked eye, determined.
If sugar is present, the melting-point
of the crystals will be at a temperature
of 205° centigrade. If the melting-point lies
below this temperature, we have to do with
other substances (azones).</p>

<p><i>Hence it appears that we possess in the
phenylhydrazin test, applied in the manner
above described, a certain method of detecting
even the faintest traces of sugar in the
urine.</i></p>

<p>Although hitherto it has been often ascertained
that sugar was present in normal urine,
that was demonstrated only by the other
methods with which we have been hitherto
acquainted, and not by means of the phenylhydrazin
test in the manner in which we have
explained its use. This seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the reason why different authors have not
been able to speak unanimously on this subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It frequently happens that the sugar is
present in such quantities that we are able
to observe its power to rotate the plane of
polarized light.</p>

<p>For this purpose we generally use Soleil-Ventzke’s
penumbra-polarization apparatus, a
description of which will be found in the
hand-books on the subject.</p>

<p>This apparatus suffices to investigate the
dextro-rotatory and lævo-rotatory substances
in the urine. With its assistance it is also
possible to determine the quantity of sugar
in the urine. In addition for the determination
of the quantity of sugar in the urine a
number of chemical processes can be employed,
such, for instance, as Fehling’s method
with Worm-Müller’s modification, Knapp’s
method, and various others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>If we add to normal urine a dilute solution
of potassium permanganate it at once loses
its color. From this we perceive that the
urine contains a great quantity of oxidizable
or so-called reducing substances.</p>

<p>It has been already mentioned that Trommer’s
test gives positive results after protracted
boiling, even in the case of normal
urine, without any corresponding quantity of
grape-sugar being present. In this case the
reducing substances interfere with the test in
consequence of their tendency to become oxidized.</p>

<p>We find a number of them in the urine.
Foremost among them are uric acid, creatinine,
and the coloring-matter. Also the substances
mentioned above in the description of
the carbo-hydrates have reducing properties.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Different statements have been made as to
the quantity of reducing substances existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in the urine. According to Flückiger they
form from 0.15 to 0.25 per cent.; according
to Salkowski an average of 0.4 per cent., and
according to Munk an average of 0.3 per
cent.</p>

<p>Moritz found the quantity of reducing substances
range between 2.93 and 4.1 grammes
per diem in a grown man. His investigations
were made with the collected urine of
24 hours, and were applied to that of men,
women, and children. The result showed that
men always excreted a greater quantity of
reducing substances than women of the same
age who used the same food.</p>

<p>The quantity of these substances depends
upon the food taken. An increase is also
possible when certain benzoin compounds are
taken into the system. Moritz also found
that the ratio of the quantity of reducing
substances to the food was a constant, which
is the case also with the nitrogen evacuated.
An increase of the daily excretion of reducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
substances follows the free use of albumen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If, in the case of an ordinary diet, such as
men take in youth, the body performs its
labors without fatigue, it must be assumed
that the several food stuffs have been selected
from the classes of albuminous bodies, carbo-hydrates,
fats, and inorganic elements in suitable
portions and are provided in sufficient
quantity.</p>

<p>According to the statements of Pettenkofer
and Voit the total metabolism is greater during
labor than during rest. The food requisite
for a normal grown man while in a state
of rest may be reckoned at 30 units of heat
for each kilogramme of weight. In the case
of a full-grown working man, whose weight
was 70 kilogrammes, the necessary food represented
about 2,000 units of heat. For a
person whom we, following Voit, will describe
as an average working man, the requisite food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
supply consists of 118 grammes of albumen,
56 grammes of fat, and 500 grammes of
carbo-hydrates, equivalent to 3,055 units of
heat gross, or 2,749 units of heat net.</p>

<p>As a woman is generally smaller than a man,
and the weight of her body also less in comparison
with his, and her labor also less than
that of a man, if we compare men and women
of the same age, it is obvious that in her
case a less provision of force, and in consequence
less food, under similar circumstances,
is necessary than for the man. Voit assigns
to a working woman a food supply of 94
grammes albumen, 45 grammes fat, and 400
grammes carbo-hydrates, which correspond to
2,444 units of heat gross, and 2,200 units of
heat net, whilst the whole of the food taken
by an average working man, according to
Voit, is fixed at 118 grammes albumen, 56
grammes fat, 500 grammes carbo-hydrates,
equivalent to 3,035 units of weight gross, and
2,749 units of weight net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Many consider that the quantity of albumen
is placed too high. For this reason
Munk assigns a lower quantity of albumen
for the food. Yet the numbers which he
gives do not vary much from those of Voit.</p>

<p>In youth several very marked differences
appear in the metabolism, and especially in
the quantity of carbonic acid given off, and
these differences appear in both sexes. (Tiegerstedt.)</p>

<p>In the case of a male individual from fourteen
to nineteen, the quantity of carbonic
acid given off is greater than in the case of
those who are younger or older of the same
sex. During the same years, also, a more
rapid increase of weight takes place, and a
marked increase in height. This shows an
increased metabolism, which is occasioned by
the greater addition of substance to the body.</p>

<p>In the case of the female individual this
increased excretion of carbonic acid does not
occur at the same age. A girl of eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gives off nearly the same quantity of carbonic
acid as a grown woman.</p>

<p>The quantity of carbonic acid given off by
both sexes shows that, at like ages and under
like circumstances, the quantity given off by
men in their younger years is considerably
greater than that given off by women.</p>

<p>When the time of the increase of the body
is completed, at the end of the period of
growth, with both sexes there is little difference
between the ingesta and the egesta.
The difference also between the sexes is
much less, and in advanced life completely
vanishes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It will be seen from the above brief statements
respecting metabolism in both sexes
that a difference is perceptible, and this
implies the possibility of carrying out an
attempt to express that difference numerically.
It would lead us too far were we
here to set forth all the consequences connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
with these facts in the case of both
sexes, with reference to growth, physical condition,
etc. These are sufficiently known
from the data given in other technical works
which treat of the characteristic differences
between man and woman in different ages.</p>

<p>I shall here call attention to one peculiarity
only of the human female, which is this, that
the female organism, in consequence of the
less abundant formation of tissue, is on a
smaller scale than that of the male, and yet
the amount of sugar given off in the urine
is, under normal circumstances, nearly the
same in quantity as in the case of the male.</p>

<p>Where there is less abundant formation of
tissue there must be evidently less strength.
Consequently a weakness in the organism,
such as is present where we find the normal
excretion of sugar, will have a more marked
influence upon the work done than a greater
weakness of the same kind would have where
the mass of the body was greater and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
matter taken for combustion greater also. In
other words, the sugar excreted in a normal
way in the urine of the man does not indicate
so significant a loss of the heat produced
by combustion as it indicates in the case of
the woman.</p>

<p><i>When, in addition to this, a woman is in the
earlier period of her life, at which time an
ovulation takes place regularly every month</i>,
it is not a matter of indifference whether a
good and complete use is being made or not
being made of the matter taken as nourishment.</p>

<p>Also, though the excretion of sugar in insignificant
quantities in a normal way is not
detrimental to the whole organism, yet it appears,
as we shall see presently, not to be a
matter of indifference as regards the ovum
forming itself and ripening in the human female.</p>

<p>Now, if we take further into consideration
the observation which I made many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
ago, that sugar often occurs in the urine of
women, and also in larger quantities than we
observe in the case of men, it is obvious that
this symptom ought to arrest our attention.
Certainly we often meet with female urine
which shows us clearly that the process of
combustion in the organism in question is
being perfectly effected. Practically in such
urine no sugar is detected by the reactions
which have been mentioned above, not even
by the phenylhydrazin test. Yet, in the case
of many of these women, although no change
has been made in the diet, sugar is found in
the urine temporarily in inconsiderable quantities
shortly before and shortly after menstruation.
The methods of investigation which
we have applied gave at these epochs a positive
result.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The appearance of sugar in the urine does
not occur only amongst women of the upper
classes, who enjoy a better and varied diet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
but also amongst those of the poorer classes,
who are obliged to subsist chiefly upon vegetable
food.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the case of vegetarians who take
concentrated albuminous substances only in
the form in which they occur in eggs, and get
animal fat and sugar from milk alone, the
urine, as regards the occurrence of sugar, is
of the same character as that of those who
do not adhere to vegetarianism. Women, who,
in other climes, are not within the reach of
our investigations, might also be included in
the same category so far as their diet is concerned.</p>

<p>It follows that the individual does not excrete
sugar only in consequence of the character
of the diet, but that the <i>processes of
combustion</i> manifest themselves in the results
derived from the digestion of the different
nutriments.</p>

<p>Now, an indispensable condition of the ripening
of the ovum in the female organism is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that the metabolic process shall be normal.
When these changes are being effected as
perfectly as possible, sugar is entirely absent
from the urine. The female individual may
have arranged and chosen her diet from the
different groups of food in any conceivable
way, and she may belong to this or that class
of the community, but the metabolic processes—that
is to say, the combustion processes—are,
nevertheless, those which deserve most
attention in connection with the development
of the ovum.</p>

<p>Ovulation is never in any case altogether
independent of the influences of diet and
metabolism. In those cases where the combustion
is of such a kind that unoxidized remains
of bodies still capable of producing
heat are found in the urine, the ovum in
process of development in the human female
is never so highly developed as in the cases
where no sugar, or at least no recognizable
trace of it, can be found in the urine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p><i>In the first case we shall have not only a
less ripe ovum, but very likely also a less well-nourished
ovum. An ovum of this sort has
not so fully attained to all the characteristics
and powers inherent in its protoplasm, and, in
consequence, seems fitted to develop only a female
individual. In such an ovum the several
cell-products of the ovum, which have to develop
themselves into the future embryo, will
be arranged for the growth of a female. Not
only will female organs of generation be developed
from it, but also all the elements of
the future individual will be feminine.</i></p>

<p>On the contrary, if in the mother-individual
all the substances developed in, or taken into,
the organism <i>undergo combustion in such a
manner that no sugar is found in the urine,
not even in the smallest quantities, then an
ovum can be developed such as is required to
produce a male individual. Out of its protoplasm
in the course of evolution elements form
themselves, whence male cells are developed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
which correspond to the development of tissues
and forms of the male individual. Some of
the cells—viz.: those which ultimately become
the elements for the continuation of the species,
are planned for the male sex.</i></p>

<p>It follows from all this that the result depends
to a great extent both upon the diet
chosen, and upon whether it has been rightly
chosen to suit the organism, whether it is
possible to exert such an influence as may so
support the ovum in its maturation that in its
development it may form itself into a male
individual. It must be observed in advance
that such an influence as may be effective
for the production of sex must not be applied
to an already fertilized ovum, but must be
applied to an ovum in development before
its fertilization.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is even of greater importance to
know that the mother individual has been for
a considerable period anterior to the fertilization
of the ovum provided with the requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
food. Care must also be taken that <i>after</i>
conception a similar befitting diet is continued
for the mother, which diet should resemble
that previously provided.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of what sort must the chosen diet be
which can favor the ripening of the ovum?
Always only such a diet as can so modify the
process of food assimilation in the organism
that no excretion even of the most minute
quantity of sugar discoverable by the application
of the phenylhydrazin test can be detected.</p>

<p>The quantity of sugar is small, but what
has to be taken into consideration here is not
so much the amount of the sugar, as the fact
that this substance is being excreted.</p>

<p>Now, it has been proved by experience that
when in an organism a symptom appears, as
the evidence of disease, in the form of a
considerable excretion of sugar in the urine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
it is in many cases possible, by the means of
fitting diet, to produce a diminution of the
excretion of sugar, either bringing it down to
a small amount or causing it to disappear
altogether.</p>

<p>Investigation of the urine according to recognized
methods must accompany this system
of diet, and, under normal circumstances,
we soon meet with the phenomenon, at which
we have been aiming—that the quantity of
sugar has diminished to a no longer perceptible
amount. When this has been attained,
it may be presumed that, by a further perseverance
with the same diet, the metabolism
will be so regulated that, if no pathological
accident supervenes, the excretion of sugar
will cease. In fact, in consequence of an
alteration of diet and the taking of no excessive
quantities of starch and sugar, the
excretion of sugar in the urine ceases for a
considerable time, and only makes its reappearance
after a long interval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>When, in consequence of having observed
the minute normal quantity of sugar in the
urine, my attention was attracted to the fact
that the determination of the future sex was
connected with the presence of this sugar,
my endeavors were directed to exercising
such an influence over its presence as might
enable me to get rid of it. Experiments with
the most diverse diets gave me in the case
of women most remarkable results. In this
way I found women, using an almost exclusively
flesh diet (which was, of course, especially
rich in nitrogen), whose urine showed
greater quantities of sugar—according to approximate
estimations—than when they used
a diet of carbo-hydrates, that is, sugar, fatty
substances, alcohols, etc. Others, again, showed
an exactly opposite result. In many cases I
did not succeed in getting rid of the normal
sugar in the urine; in others it disappeared
soon after the beginning of the treatment. It
follows that, in every case where the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is one of so influencing the sex that a male
offspring may be obtained, the very first
thing to be determined is whether the normal
quantity of sugar is present in the woman’s
urine or not. If none can be detected after
repeated and painstaking search, and if reducing
substances are plentifully present,
we do not require to arrange the diet, but
can recommend immediate impregnation, as
every probability points to a male embryo.
But in all cases where the normal “urine-sugar”—if
I may so call it—is present,
even if only traces of it are to be found,
it will then be our task, by various alterations
of diet, to discover that one which
seems suited to the organism in such a way
that it will occasion the disappearance of
every trace of the “urine-sugar.” In these
experiments the remarkable phenomenon is
observable, that the reducing substances
which I have already mentioned, and
amongst these especially the lævo-rotatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
glycuronic acid compounds, show alterations
in respect of quantity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In fact, I found that the urine of most
women who had male offspring contained,
during the first months of pregnancy, more
reducing substances than the urine of women
who had female offspring. It is, therefore,
also necessary that the diet should not only
occasion a disappearance of the normal urine-sugar,
but should also produce an increase of
the reducing substances. This end can be
accomplished certainly also by the use of different
medicines, such as chloroform, turpentine,
salicylic acid, etc. But, apart from the
fact that medicinal influences are distinctly
to be discouraged, these substances do not
seem to produce the same effects as diet.
Besides, it is still a question of what kind
these efficient substances are. And another
question is whether they are themselves effective.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
It will be sufficient for us to recognize
them as a symptom.</p>

<p>It is known that the male sex possesses a
distinctly greater amount of albumen than the
female. In age this difference disappears; in
youth it is greater. It might be expected
that male offspring would result, in consequence
of a more albuminous diet, by which
a greater increment of albumen would be
made possible; the thing, however, is not
quite so simple as this. Investigations in various
cases showed me that women in whom
an increased amount of albumen could be detected,
but in whom either sugar was present
to a small extent, or, on the other hand, only
very small quantities of reducing substances
could be detected, almost always had female
offspring.</p>

<p>In spite of many endeavors to elucidate
this phenomenon, I was forced to have recourse
to the symptoms alone, and to hope
for the production of the male sex only from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the disappearance of the sugar and the increase
of the reducing substances. Certainly,
further investigations showed that the same
diet which was the most favorable to the production
of the condition which I have named
(the disappearance of the sugar from the urine
and the simultaneous increase of the reducing
substances), also effected the best albuminous
increment in the body. Key’s statements
teach us that male individuals put on more
albumen than females, and that this is especially
the case during the period of growth.
Very likely the male embryo also requires a
greater amount of albumen than the female,
in the same way as this difference
exists between the boy and girl.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We know as a universal rule that where
there is rest there must be a balance of
forces. If the ovum, the accumulator of the
balanced forces in a state of rest, is to divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
itself so as to produce in this way the future
individual, some stimulant impulse, some
energy is absolutely necessary to disturb the
balance of forces, and to induce the development
of the cells. This impulse may
be such a one as occasions destruction. But
it may also be one that gives occasion to new
growth, to tissue formation. (W. Haacke.)
We must describe this impulse as functional,
and recognize in it a peculiarity which belongs
to the organic world alone, the vegetable
and animal kingdom. Every movement,
every use of an organ, may serve as a stimulant
impulse, and contribute to its development.
Thus we find, in the case of great
thinkers and poets, of celebrated generals,
etc., a powerfully developed brain. Oarsmen,
gymnasts, and swimmers have far stronger
muscles than men who follow less fatiguing
callings. In all these cases there are impulses
leading to increased growth of the organs. In
the growth of the fertilized ovum we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
deal again with a phenomenon of impulse, a
part of which is the property of the ovum
itself, a part, however, also dependent upon
external influences. We call the former
autoplastic, the latter xenoplastic impulse.
(Haacke.) It is easy to understand that a
purely autoplastic development (<i>eine reine
Autoplasie</i>, a pure autoplasia) cannot exist.
Out of an ovum alone, without the agency of
new impulses, without the taking up of new
matter, no new individual could develop.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stomach furnishes the gastric juice. It
is stimulated to do so by the food. The food
is digested, undergoes absorption in the intestine,
and becomes lymph. Blood is formed.
The blood passes through the several organs
and tissues, nourishes them, and replaces the
substances used up by work. As soon, therefore,
as the stomach and intestine, with the
intestinal glands, fail in their functions, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the organs, which stand in physical relation
with them, suffer; because they are constantly
during their work consuming matter,
and are now receiving no fresh supplies.
The case of the other juices of the body is
the same. The thyroid glands supply the
body with a principle without which a person
cannot be in a normal condition. Similarly
the testicles, as glands, supply the body
with a principle the want of which gives a
man distinctly female qualities, as we perceive
in the case of eunuchs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is no doubt that the males and
females of a race of animals develop out of
the same germinal-matter. Its development
depends upon two important factors, the impulse,
and the capacity to take up matter
conditioned thereby. By taking up matter
the substance of the newly developed cells is
increased, and this in turn prompts them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
repeated division, until at last an organ is
developed. The new organ again furnishes
new impulses, and so influences the development
of other organs. The impulses are of
themselves physical and chemical. (Haacke.)
In the ovule and the embryo the impulses
are what chiefly bring about new growth.
These impulses the ovum receives from the
mother whose product it is. Now, as of the
most different impulses now one and now
another comes to the front, the embryo
will acquire at this time rather these qualities,
and at that time those. The impulse
will occasion now a greater addition of
matter to this organ, and now a greater
addition of matter to that. According to
observations made up to the present time,
there is hardly any doubt that the development
of the organs of sex requires an impulse
as does the development of all the
other organs. These sex-determining impulses
originate, like the other development-determining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
influences, from the mother,
since it is she that supplies to the embryo, as
agencies of impulse, the juices derived from
the food which she has taken. In addition
to these, the embryo receives also from the
mother such products as are required for
the growth that follows the impulse. If the
mother gives the child no material for growth
and no impulse, then the child, since it is dependent
upon the mother, must perish. Now,
according as a developing ovum or an embryo
either receives the juice, the means of
impulse, for the acquisition of the male sex,
or for the acquisition of the female sex, so
will a male or a female result.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of what kind the means of impulse are,
the juices are, which occasion this I do not
know. I can only supply the conditions requisite
for them; I can see only whether they
are present. And so I again come back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
this, that we may expect a male individual
from the ovum when the juices are developed
which serve as a functional means of impulse
for the male sex. These juices can come
into existence in the organism under the
most different circumstances. But they certainly
do come into existence, if we can so
feed the mother that we cannot find in her
urine even the faintest trace of sugar, but
instead of it an increased excretion of reducing
substances, <i>accompanied by a relatively
high exchange of nitrogenous substances</i>. These
facts can, therefore, serve us only as a symptom
of processes taking place in the organism.
In consequence our task will be to follow
up in the various cases the conditions of
this symptom, <i>in order that we may try so to
feed the mother individual that she may attain
to giving the effective impulse</i>; and this we
have certainly accomplished by the increased
excretion of the reducing substances and the
disappearance of the normal urine-sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>When we have brought a woman into such
a condition that she excretes no sugar, and
by the continuation of the same diet keep
her permanently in that condition, the ovule
which is being developed in her organism
will develop itself correspondingly. Also
with this diet the different qualities of the
organism may not be altogether without influence
on the course of the ovum’s development.</p>

<p>In many cases the quantity of sugar in the
urine excreted does not diminish. The most
different kinds of diet may be tried, and yet
the phenylhydrazin test will always show the
presence of sugar. Individuals of this sort
exhibit a certain obstinacy in resisting the
attempt to procure an alteration of the metabolism.
In such cases no influence has been
exerted over the development of the ovum.</p>

<p>In these experiments which are made with
the mother, not only is the ovum influenced
which is being developed for fertilization in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the maternal organism, but it is also possible
for the mother herself, in consequence
of the alteration of diet, to experience many
changes with regard to the physical peculiarities
of the elements which compose her
body.</p>

<p>The treatment may prove highly beneficial
to the mother herself, so that not ovulation
alone is subjected to an alteration, but the
activity of the processes of the tissues of the
other organs of the body may be also simultaneously
in some way changed. And here
may come into consideration many other factors
which may produce a particular fitness
for procreation and for the development of
the ovum, and, if they once make themselves
felt, may be of the greatest advantage to the
mother.</p>

<p>The formation of the insignificant quantity
of sugar in the body goes on of itself regularly,
without it being possible to perceive
any consequent striking alterations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
organism. The manner in which sugar is
formed in the body under normal conditions
has in recent years been thus explained.</p>

<p>The sugar contained in the blood in healthy
persons is reckoned as not higher than about
0.15 per cent. In those who suffer from diabetes
it may rise to 0.44 per cent. If sugar
is present in the blood, that it passes thence
into the urine can be easily explained, seeing
that the excreted products of decomposition
from the blood pass into the urine. Thus the
sugar results from a portion of the food which
is transformed into sugar, and so passes into
the portal vein. (Strümpell.)</p>

<p>There exists also in the liver and muscles
a non-nitrogenous substance, glycogen, which
is detected also in other organs. This glycogen
probably arises partly from the carbo-hydrates
of the food, but certainly from the
albuminous substances taken with the food,
which, when broken up, separate into nitrogenous
products and glycogen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>When the glycogen is once formed, we
may regard it as an intermediate substance
which is changed into sugar, probably by a
saccharine fermentation, and then can reach
the blood. How glycogen is transformed
into sugar within the organism is unknown.
Normally occurring sugar results from glycogen.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p>When, years ago, my attention was first
attracted by the idea that, for the solution of
our problem, we ought to turn our attention
to the sugar in normal urine, no very exact
tests for sugar were possible. The reactions
were not very sensitive, the fact being that
the surest evidence of the presence of sugar
was obtained not from the reduction processes
but from the method used by Brücker
for preparing a potassium compound of sugar.</p>

<p>Every investigation which I undertook in
his times for the confirmation of my theory
was very arduous. The few cases which I
at first had under observation presented formidable
difficulties. The occasion of my first
turning my attention to sugar in the urine
was a case of a woman who had borne five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
children, and, after violent and continuous
mental excitement, was suddenly seized with
diabetes mellitus. I frequently examined her
urine, and always found an abnormal amount
of sugar. She had twice given birth to children
whilst suffering from diabetes, and on
each occasion the child was a female. This
fact struck me, because previously, whilst she
was strong and well, she had borne sons only.
But, on the appearance of the disease mentioned,
she had two daughters in succession,
of whom the first one lived and the other
was still-born.</p>

<p>I numbered amongst my acquaintances a
family, of whom, in the course of years, I
was acquainted with the grandmother, a
daughter, and two grand-daughters. The
grandmother had, including the third generation,
fifteen descendants, of whom twelve
were girls and three were boys. Two of the
boys were the sons of the grandmother, and
the first two children she had borne. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was under medical treatment, and the analysis
of the urine showed a considerable quantity
of sugar. She had six daughters. One
of these daughters, who survived the others,
had five children, amongst them one boy,
who soon died.</p>

<p>Two of the grand-daughters of this family
became mothers, each bearing one daughter.
I had the opportunity of examining
the urine of all the mothers of this family,
and always found sugar in it. Sometimes
the saccharine contents reached a remarkable
quantity, and yet were not such as
could be diagnosed to indicate an unhealthy
condition.</p>

<p>Amongst the acquaintances of my youth
was a young lady of good family. Carefully
reared, she was, as a child, too much sheltered
from the influences of the open air, and
in later years much imprisoned in-doors by
hard study in different branches of art and
science. As a young lady she was fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
tall and well nourished, but pale and possessed
of little color.</p>

<p>It happened that I had an opportunity of
examining this young lady’s urine. As I found
a considerable quantity of sugar, I was led
to the conclusion that the girl (she was engaged)
would have principally female offspring.</p>

<p>Many years had elapsed. The young lady
had ripened into a stately matron, and told
me that she had the happiness to be the
mother of five daughters and a son. I am
altogether without the statistics necessary to
deduce from a great number of similar cases
the average relative number of the sexes
born of women suffering from diabetes. But
this must be pointed out, that, notwithstanding
the high percentage of sugar excreted
in the case of women suffering from pronounced
diabetes, female offspring do not
necessarily always appear. They will probably
be in a very striking majority when
compared with the males, but the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
disappearance of the male sex is not to be
anticipated, because male individuals, though
in the minority, can appear. And this was
to be anticipated, seeing that in the so-called
slighter cases of this complaint the abnormal
metabolism can be sensibly improved by attention
to diet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Diabetes amongst women has a marked
influence upon the functions of the sexual
organs. Thus, for example, the menses cease,
a condition which, according to gynæcologists,
is occasioned by an abnormal condition of
the womb and of the ovaries which become
atrophied. (Schauta.) On the other
hand, diabetes may also result from diseases
of the reproductive organs. (Imlach.) When
the cause of the complaint is removed from
the female genitals the sugar also disappears
from the urine.</p>

<p>From both of these facts, which rest upon
medical observation, it follows that the excretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of sugar has some definite connection
with the processes at work in the female
generative organs. In the cases when the excretion
of sugar continues for a considerable
time, it is of greater significance, and indicates
chronic derangement of the metabolism,
in connection with which a serious change
comes over the internal organs of generation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, if there is a possibility that disturbances
so extensive can be set up in the female
genital tract when there is an excretion
of sugar, it is also very possible that
certain modifications may be produced by
a small <i>constant</i> excretion of sugar. These
changes can show themselves in the ovum to
this extent, that they may be of considerable
significance and not without influence upon
the development of sex.</p>

<p>Women who suffer from pronounced diabetes
frequently miscarry. In what way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
disease influences ovulation I cannot here discuss.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The connection of the development of sex
with an imperfect physiological combustion of
the food can only be considered as demonstrated,
if it is possible, by means of certain
exact experiments in this direction to reach
results which incontestably make for the possibility
of influencing sex. Cases of this kind,
in which the work of observation was conducted
by myself alone, and in families closely
connected with me, where there were exceptional
wishes in this direction, I shall mention
presently.</p>

<p>Most striking of all are the cases where
a number of daughters have come into the
world one after another as the results of a
marriage.</p>

<p>The condition of a woman in a well-regulated
married state, <i>when, as we will suppose,
five or six girls are born, one after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
another, must be considered to be of a kind
that departs more or less from the normal</i>.
The human female, if we regard the general
statistical data, ought to bring forth approximately
the same number of male and female
individuals. If we find so remarkable an excess
in the direction either of males or females,
that six or seven of the same sex
follow one another, there must be a reason
for this. In my opinion that cause is now
to be ascertained only from the results of
analysis of the urine for sugar, mentioned
above.</p>

<p>In the cases where we have to deal with
an excessive predominance of female offspring,
Trommer’s test will show us the presence
of sugar. But it is safest, as I have already
said, to use the phenylhydrazin test in
the manner described. If it be demonstrated
that in any such case sugar practically exists
in the urine, in never so small a quantity,
dietetic treatment is to be resorted to, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
even the minutest trace of sugar has been
made to disappear.</p>

<p>The treatment consists in giving the mother
a highly nitrogenous diet with fat, and adding
only so much carbo-hydrate as is absolutely
necessary to prevent its want being
felt.</p>

<p>This diet should be continued for a considerable
time, even although the sugar in the
urine may have disappeared. It is best to
begin the change of diet a good while (about
2 or 3 months) before impregnation. During
the menstruations which fall within this period,
the ripened ova will be voided unfertilized,
and new ova which have been influenced
by the altered conditions of nutrition in the
organism will ripen in their place.</p>

<p>(If we follow such information as we have
concerning the development of sex in man,
we thence conclude that the difference in sex
appears at the beginning of the third month
of pregnancy, and is definitely expressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the fourth month. From this it would appear
not to be superfluous if the recommended
alteration of diet was maintained until the
beginning of the third month.)</p>

<p>When the ovule of a human female, dieted
in this way, becomes fertilized, it has been
so far ripened by the process of nutrition conducted
in the organism of the mother, that
when it attains the stage of development, it
resolves itself into cells which compose an
organism containing male characteristics.</p>

<p>After impregnation it is still advantageous
that whilst the condition of the urine is examined
at intervals of a few days, the corresponding
diet should be continued during the
advancing stages of the development.</p>

<p>Although I do not here take the trouble
to illustrate these diet processes by explanations,
every one can have regard to these
particulars for himself, and conduct the diet
even after impregnation has taken place in
accordance with the information given above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>In a case like that mentioned, where, after
marriage, female ova were successively formed
and developed, practically a process of physiological
combustion was going on in the mother
which did not suffice for deriving all the advantage
possible from the food, so that the
available elements might be all oxidized. In
consequence, only female ova were fertilized
and only female individuals born. This condition
of things remained the same for a
number of years.</p>

<p>In such a case the question is not alone
one of a small residuum of sugar, but in
addition to this it is probably not impossible
that other substances also were evacuated from
the body, to make use of which was not within
the power of the process of combustion.</p>

<p>With a rational diet, these substances also
might be withheld from evacuation and, as
well as the sugar, be made available for combustion
with a corresponding increase of nourishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>In experiments of this kind metabolic activity
will show itself in the organism, as it
may be perceived from the nitrogenous constituents
of the urine that a greater exchange
of nutritive matter is taking place, a thing
that happens also with normal individuals.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the specific gravity
of the urine is also increased, and it may
sometimes become relatively considerable (1030
to 1035).</p>

<p>In consequence of the influence which the
altered diet, if commenced a sufficiently long
time before conception, exerts both over the
mother and over the ovum which is being
prepared for fertilization, it is possible that
this ovum may develop itself into a male individual.</p>

<p>It also sometimes happens that, even with
careful dieting, the conditions which are necessary
for our purpose are not realized—viz.:
that the sugar does not disappear from the
urine, that the mother cannot accommodate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
herself to a diet of the kind required. She
finds the situation intolerable, because she
cannot do without an abundance of starchy
substances and sugar, and in consequence all
hope of a satisfactory result falls to the
ground.</p>

<p>There are persons who from their youth
upwards have lived principally on vegetable
food, and are therefore not accustomed to
take the nitrogenous substances of their diet
in the concentrated form in which they are
presented in the albuminous constituent of
meat. They obtain the necessary nitrogen
for the body from large amounts of food containing
a great quantity of water, and it may
happen that they cannot easily submit themselves
to such a change of diet without pernicious
consequences. To this class belong
the women who live in the rural districts of
many of the mountainous regions of central
Europe, where little flesh is eaten. With them
it might often be a difficult matter to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
an abrupt change of diet of the desired kind.
Such individuals can be reconciled to the
kind of diet we recommend only by a gradual
advance in the quantity of concentrated nitrogenous
food. But in such cases it might very
likely prove possible to attain our end by a
corresponding vegetable diet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following case, which was conducted
under my control with the greatest care, and
was also a case of an intelligent woman,
who showed the greatest willingness to do
anything, in order that she might have male
offspring, is of the highest interest for our
theory.</p>

<p>This woman was of a family in which principally
female children had been born. Although
all its members were fruitful, no great
number of descendants seemed to have been
reached. It is not unlikely that the multiplication
of descendants was restrained. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
existence of a tendency to provide female ova
for fertilization was also proved by testing the
urine for sugar.</p>

<p>In the case of this woman, who wished to
have male offspring, the examination of the
urine each time showed, as with the other
women of the family, traces of sugar. With
her ordinary diet sugar was found in the
urine (that of twenty-four hours being collected)
in minute quantities. The unoxidized
minute traces of sugar signified imperfect
combustion.</p>

<p>When the diet is to be altered, it is necessary
to select it in such a way that the nitrogenous
substances may predominate and that
the carbo-hydrates may be excluded as far as
possible. Of course a sufficient quantity of
fat must be added to the food.</p>

<p>The food to be taken was regulated on these
principles, and the dieting began. After eight
days the last traces of sugar in the urine had
disappeared. The woman’s health was good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and she at once showed herself contented
with the highly nitrogenous diet.</p>

<p>The menses lasted five days, and after them,
five more days having elapsed, impregnation
took place, the same diet continuing. After
about eight weeks of pregnancy the food was
gradually altered. The state of the woman’s
health during pregnancy presented no remarkable
features. She had taken all necessary
care of herself, and her condition during the
pregnancy, in like manner as before it, when
she had to alter her diet until the sugar disappeared
from the urine, was satisfactory.
She was in due course confined of a boy.</p>

<p>A year and a half passed. The woman
bore, after similar treatment as on the former
occasion, a second boy. In the interval
no further control was exercised over her
way of living, but a few weeks before she
conceived means were taken to regulate her
diet, so that no perceptible trace of sugar
resulted from its physiological combustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>During five years this woman did not conceive.
The results of examinations of the
urine, which were made from time to time,
showed quite clearly that sugar was always
normally present. The quantity was not
determined. At the end of this period the
woman, after a long rest, and a similar preliminary
dieting, once more became pregnant.
This time also the result was a boy. After
two years another boy followed. In this case
also a similar process of dieting had preceded.</p>

<p>After such occurrences it was sufficiently
demonstrated that it could be only the influence
of the diet that showed itself in this
way; because in this case one would be convinced
that it was not a mere accident that
the woman here spoken of produced only
male offspring.</p>

<p>In the case of this woman it was evidently
the diet that affected the development of sex,
and exerted such an influence that, under the
improved conditions, the metabolism both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the mother and in the ripening ovum preparing
for fecundation, took such a form that
a male individual was developed.</p>

<p>She again became pregnant after a lapse
of two years. Before her pregnancy the
same system of diet was followed as on
the previous occasions. She miscarried in the
fifth month. Violent emotions and mortifications,
accompanied by anxious cares, were,
together with other coincident unfavorable
circumstances, the cause of the miscarriage.
The offspring was male.</p>

<p>Soon after, some four months after the miscarriage,
she again became pregnant. Also
on this occasion dieting had preceded, such
as I have frequently carried out for the development
of a male individual. But a miscarriage
again supervened. The fœtus was
obviously male.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But what was now wanting was an experiment
that could be added to the preceding, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
would serve to show that a human female,
who, under the influence of our method of
dieting, invariably bore sons, would, in the
case of paying no attention to diet, bring a
female into the world.</p>

<p>The evidence was forthcoming, for the
woman in question again became pregnant
without any consideration being bestowed on
her bodily condition, and without anything
being done to remove the traces of sugar
from the urine. After having seven times
borne males she became this time mother of
a female, which, born before the due time,
soon died. After that she was not again
pregnant. Probably some change supervened
in consequence of which she became permanently
unfruitful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This incident shows sufficiently that the
ovum in the case of the woman who served
for our experiment possessed an inherent
tendency to develop into a female, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
also ripe enough to be fertilized. As we had
exercised no influence upon it so as to effect
any change in the ovum (in the same way as
we had previously been able to affect the
others by the diet in order to procure the
ovum of a male) the result was a female.</p>

<p>The female tendency was therefore already
present in the ovum, and indeed the mother
supplied convincing evidence of the female
constitution of the ovum whilst it was yet
unfertilized, because sugar existed in her
urine. The previous determination of the
sex could also in this case present no difficulty.
In the earlier cases, when male individuals
followed one another, we always
aimed, by means of our support given by
means of the nourishment of the mother, not
only at the ripening of the ovum which was
to be fertilized, but also at the development of
a male individual. In the last case the ovum
was, without any assistance, capable of being
fertilized, but it developed into a female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>A ripe, fertilizable ovum in the ovary of a
woman whose urine habitually contains sugar
has a tendency, when the proper conditions
are supplied, to develop into a female. In
consequence, it is in such cases from the
outset possible, without exercising any influence
over the mother, without adopting any
diet, to anticipate after a conception, the
birth of a female individual. But if these
conditions do not exist, if no sugar can be
detected in the urine, the use of the same
influence in order to obtain a male individual
is still not superfluous. In this case also
there is a need of an alteration of diet,
although the individual in question accomplishes
the process of physiological combustion
in a manner which must be called the most
favorable possible, seeing that with a mixed
diet all the oxidizable materials are completely
used up.</p>

<p>Supposing that a mother of this sort wished
for female offspring, one would not be in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
position to give any advice. In this case one
cannot, according to the facts which have
been mentioned above, exercise any influence
over an alteration in the course of the development
of the ovum which would occasion the
birth of a female. Such a mother is, up to
the present time, beyond the reach of an
influence that can affect the development of
the future sex.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two other cases follow in which male children
were desired, several females having so
far been the offspring of the marriage. The
corresponding arrangements for the regulation
of the diet, which led to the complete
disappearance of sugar from the urine, showed
themselves effective in the ripening of the
ovum, and, after conception had taken place,
in both cases a male individual was formed
and developed.</p>

<p>In addition to this, four other cases were
under observation, in which no influence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
exercised on sugar occurring in the urine in
quantities, such as correspond to a normal
healthy state. Without any kind of influence
of diet, three females were born.</p>

<p>In a fourth case I had a negative result.
In three cases the result was positive. In
the last three cases I was able to examine
the urine as often as I wished, whilst in one
case I was allowed to do so only at long
intervals as a favor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now in conclusion endeavor to make
some short reflections on the results which
we are able to attain.</p>

<p>First of all one would say that in certain
regions and among certain peoples, where
meat forms the principal diet, only male, or
principally male, offspring would be anticipated.</p>

<p>The nutrition of the mother certainly plays
a leading part in the development of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
ovum within her body. The different experiments
which breeders have made, and
the observations which have repeatedly shown
in the case of the invertebrata (v. Berlepsch,
‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Biene und ihre Zucht</i>,’ second edition;
Landois, ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Physiologie</i>’), a connection between
food and the development of sex leave no
doubt that, in the case of the human subject
also, a certain diet of the mother would not
be without influence on the ovum developing
within her. Here, however, in the case of
the ripening of the ovum, according to my
opinion, the result does not depend on the
diet alone, but rather on the process of
metabolism in the mother.</p>

<p>How the physiological combustion goes on
in the organism, and what changes take place
in it, in consequence of the altered diet,
until the sugar entirely disappears, is in the
case of human beings of the highest importance,
and furnishes an index of the consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>In individual cases the diet is directed in
accordance with the results that show how
the food has been assimilated and does not
depend upon these alone. In other words,
whether the mother eats much meat is a secondary
consideration. Whether and how the
food taken is completely made use of in the
process of combustion—that is a matter of
importance for the purpose we have in view.</p>

<p>Any one, who keeps before him the fundamental
principles of this theory, will see
plainly that it is possible, under certain circumstances,
to procure male progeny by
means of the influence we have indicated.
<i>The wish to have female progeny is a desire
for the gratification of which it is not at
present possible to give any directions.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In connection with all that I have already
said I will here mention that the method
which I employed to procure the ripening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
an ovum for male progeny in cases where I
had previously found sugar normally present,
which served as an indication for the application
of my treatment, I attempted to apply
also in the case of individuals with whom no
trace of sugar was to be found. The method
of proceeding, judging by my experiences
thus far, should be as follows.</p>

<p>First of all, it must be elicited whether any
special disease exists, and especially any that
indicates anomalies in the metabolism. Of
course capacity for generation and the possibility
of conception are presupposed.</p>

<p>If the history of the case shows no circumstances
that would hinder the application of
the method, we inform the patient that she
must furnish us with the urine necessary for
the occasional examination. It is best to use
for this purpose a urine glass marked in
grammes and containing two litres, in which
the urine of twenty-four hours is to be collected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well at the beginning of the procedure
to put a few drops of formaline into the
measuring-glass, so that the urine may not,
in consequence of standing, decompose, and
so become unfit for accurate analysis. Of the
collected quantity of twenty-four hours, about
200 grammes should be poured into a small
phial, well corked, and used for analysis. In
making the analysis it is best to proceed in
the following order: First, we determine the
<i>reaction</i> of the urine with litmus paper. In
normal urine the reaction is generally acid.
Next the <i>specific gravity</i> is determined. This
is most easily done with Ultzmann’s urometer,
by means of which the density of
the urine can be easily determined. That
varies in normal urine generally between 1015
and 1020. In exceptional cases it may sink
very low, which often happens after much
fluid has been taken. In other cases it rises
under pathological circumstances enormously
high, as, for example, in diabetes. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
case of a thorough preparation of the organism
by the use of a great quantity of concentrated
nitrogenous food with a view to
influencing sex, the specific gravity very
often reaches 1030 and more.</p>

<p>After the specific gravity we measure next
the <i>quantity of urine</i> collected in the twenty-four
hours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We proceed next to determine the normal
<i>urine-sugar</i>, and for this purpose use a number
of the well-known tests—Nylander’s, the
fermentation test, and Trommer’s test—which
have been already described. If these give a
positive result, we proceed to a quantitative
examination by means of the polariscope. If
the quantity of sugar found is very small,
we exert ourselves to get rid of it by a suitable
diet, because otherwise no certain influence
over the embryo in the direction of the
production of male offspring can be exercised.
If, however, we find no sugar by any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
above tests, we seek for it by means of the
phenylhydrazin test also described above. A
few experiments on the melting point of the
phenyl-glycosazon crystals will easily give us
certain information. In the analysis we observe
particularly whether the positive result
of the phenylhydrazin test has originated
from the sugar or from the reducing substances.
With the polarization apparatus we
determine the quantity of lævo-rotatory substances,
<i>the optical rotation</i>, in per cents., as
these stand in a certain relation to the reducing
substances. We make these experiments
with urine that has not been decolorized.
The former becomes greater as the quantity
of the latter increases.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The determination of the reducing substances</i>
can be effected by Salkovski’s gravimetric
method, but I prefer Moritz’s volumetric
method, on account of its simplicity. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the experiment we prepare the following solutions:
1. A solution of sulphate of copper
of 80.78 grammes Cu S O<sub>4</sub> + 5 H<sub>2</sub> O, in a
litre; 2. Solution of caustic soda of 120
grammes Na H O, in a litre; 3. Watery solution
of ammonia, of 7.1 per cent. N H<sub>3</sub>,
specific gravity 0.9722. For conducting the
volumetric analysis we place in one of Erlenmayer’s
flasks, containing about 250 cubic
centimetres, about 2 cubic centimetres each
of the soda solution and the solution of sulphate
of copper, and add 140 cubic centimetres
of the ammonia solution. We thus obtain
a dark blue fluid, which we now boil. During
the boiling we allow the urine to be analyzed
to flow in from a burette until the
fluid becomes colorless. A table given by
Moritz in the forty-sixth volume of the ‘<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv
für klinische Medizin</i>,’ shows us in per
cents. the quantity of reducing substances contained
in the urine we have used.</p>

<p>In conclusion we investigate the condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of metabolism by <i>determining the excreted
nitrogen</i>. Nitrogen is excreted both by the
urine and the fæces. The greater part is
found in the urine, whilst, on the contrary, the
quantity of nitrogen excreted in the fæces
amounts to more than 1 gramme per day.
If, then, we determine the quantity in the
urine alone and add 0.94 gramme as a correction
for the nitrogen excreted with the
fæces, the resulting error will be unimportant.
The best and at present most useful
method of determining the nitrogen is that
of Kjeldahl. I generally use it in my analyses
as one that can be conveniently carried
out. For this purpose we place 5 cubic centimetres
of filtered urine in a long-necked
flask, add about 3 decigrammes of yellow oxide
of mercury and 10 cubic centimetres of
chemically pure sulphuric acid. We then
carefully warm the brownish-black mixture
over the flame of a Bunsen burner until it
has become colorless. We now allow it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
cool. The mixture is now poured into an
Erlenmayer flask containing three-quarters of
a litre of water, is neutralized with 30 per
cent. soda-lye, and then 40 cubic centimetres
of a 4 per cent. solution of potassium sulphide
is added. The whole is next subjected
to distillation. Decinormal sulphuric acid
contained in the receiver takes up the ammonia
which distils over. The acid still
remaining free after the completion of the
distillation is titrated with decinormal caustic
soda. As 1 cubic centimetre of decinormal
sulphuric acid corresponds to 0.0014
gramme of nitrogen, we can easily reckon
the quantity excreted daily. We know how
much nitrogen is contained in 5 cubic centimetres
of urine, and can easily find to how
much the daily quantity amounts by multiplying
by it and dividing by five.</p>

<p>The nitrogen found in the urine can be
expressed as albumen by multiplying it by
6.25 (Neumeister), at the same time making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a correction for the nitrogen in the fæces as
described above.</p>

<p>This is all that there is to say about the analysis
of the urine, which is of so much importance
for our experiments. In order to show
the practical application, I will add the following
analyses, as actually made in exercising
an influence over sex to obtain male
offspring.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. Case of a woman twenty-three years
old, who, before anything was done to influence
the sex of her offspring, had been married
five years, and had given birth to two
girls. The urine was collected from eight in
the morning until the same hour of the next
day in a measuring-glass. The quantity in
twenty-four hours was 1,650 cubic centimetres.
Analysis gave the following results:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic hang"><span class="smcap">Analysis.</span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reaction</i>: Acid.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Specific gravity</i>: 1017.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Quantity in 24 hours</i>: 1650.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Color</i>: Light yellow, fairly pale.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sugar</i>: None perceptible with Trommer’s
test, the fermentation test, and Nylander’s
test.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Phenylhydrazin test</i>: Negative.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Optical rotation</i>: Very slight, not determinable.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reducing substances</i>: 0.135 per cent.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen</i>: 12.76 (Correction 0.94).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen as albumen</i>: 79.75.</p></div>

<p>I recommended that more meat should be
taken, and that sugar and other forms of
carbo-hydrate should be avoided. After the
lapse of eight days, I again procured urine
for examination. Analysis gave the following
results:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic hang"><span class="smcap">Analysis.</span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reaction</i>: Acid.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Specific gravity</i>: 1018.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Quantity in 24 hours</i>: 1050.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Color</i>: Somewhat darker than on 17, 1.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sugar</i>: None perceptible with Trommer’s
test, the fermentation test, and Nylander’s
test.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Phenylhydrazin test</i>: Negative.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Optical rotation</i>: Not determinable.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reducing substances</i>: 0.15 per cent.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen</i>: 13.5 (Correction: 0.94).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen as albumen</i>: 84.37.</p>
</div>

<p>The result was that the reducing substances
and the nitrogen (expressed as albumen)
had increased. The diet of this woman
was constantly altered in the direction of
increasing the amount of albumen, until, after
the lapse of about three weeks, the following
results were obtained:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic hang"><span class="smcap">Analysis.</span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reaction</i>: Acid.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Specific gravity</i>: 1030.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Quantity in 24 hours</i>: 1000.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Color</i>: Dark, brownish-yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sugar</i>: Cannot be determined by Trommer’s
test, the fermentation test, and
Nylander’s test.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Phenylhydrazin test</i>: Positive; the glycosazon-crystals
have melting-point 110°
cent., therefore do not result from sugar.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Optical rotation</i>: 0.2 per cent. lævo-rotatory.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reducing substances</i>: 0.32 per cent.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen</i>: 21.9 grammes (Correction: 1
gramme).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen as albumen</i>: 136.8 grammes.</p></div>

<p>The woman was kept in this condition four
weeks. In the meantime menstruation took
place. It lasted four days, during which time
no change appeared in the analysis. An analysis
was made every week. Another menstruation
occurred, lasting four days, and impregnation
took place six days later. After this
the menses ceased. As I mentioned above,
the sex of the embryo is already determined
in the third month of pregnancy, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
reason I kept the patient under dietary influence
up to that time. In the interim I
made ten analyses at short intervals, the average
results of which I shall now give.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic hang"><span class="smcap">Average</span> of <span class="smcap">Ten Analyses</span>.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reaction</i>: Acid.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Specific gravity</i>: 1028-1032.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Quantity in 24 hours</i>: 750 cubic centimetres,
to 1200.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Color</i>: Golden yellow, always dark.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Sugar</i>: None could ever be detected.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Phenylhydrazin test</i>: Positive (owing to
the presence of glycuronic acid compounds;
melting-point of crystals 105°
cent. to 120°).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Optical rotation</i>: 0.2-0.3 per cent. lævo-rotatory.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Reducing substances</i>: 0.29-0.35 per cent.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen</i>: 17.9 grammes to 22 grammes
(Correction 1 gramme).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Nitrogen as albumen</i>: 111.8-137.5 grammes.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>When after 5 analyses the nitrogen (expressed
as albumen) had reached its highest
point, it fell suddenly. Some immediate experiments
proved that it was necessary to
give more carbo-hydrates and less albuminous
food, in order to re-establish the previous relations.</p>

<p>The woman was subsequently allowed to
follow whatever course she preferred, and
bore a fine boy at full term.</p>

<p>The task still remains of examining many
facts and theories already known which
may apparently be contradictory to our
teaching.</p>

<p>And here should be first of all taken into
consideration the experiments in diet made
by various stockbreeders (Bellingers, Wilkens,
etc.). In them, however, the results of the
analysis of the products of excretion are not
given, and in particular there is no information
respecting the combustible and useable sugar
evacuated from the organism, or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
substances from the organism which might
have been of importance for the evaluation
of the food. It is possible that in experiments
with diet, without reference to the
excretion of sugar, the results may be sometimes
in favor of the male and sometimes
in favor of the female sex, upon which latter
no active influence is exercised. Herr U. P.,
a nobleman resident in a country district of
the Russian Baltic provinces, informed me by
letter that in his herds the greater number
of calves are born in February. The February
calves are principally male. The cause
in this case may be as follows:—Conception
takes place in the May of the previous year.
After having been kept some six months in
the cow-houses, the beasts are turned into
the spring meadows, and are impregnated at
a period when metabolism is active in consequence
of their altered mode of life. All the
cows are in heat. The notable result obtained
in the ensuing February may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
explained as the consequence of the better
physiological combustion of the food.</p>

<p>According to statistics more boys than
girls are born in the years with a poor harvest.
Bad harvest years are those which
favor a flesh diet, as the food-stuffs from the
vegetable kingdom do not suffice for the cattle,
nor for the people either; in consequence
of which the cattle are killed, and more flesh
enters into the diet of the women who are
fructified. If people in general had the normal
aptness for procreation in such famine
years, the flesh-diet might turn the scale in
favor of the male sex; it being presupposed
that the other conditions were fulfilled.</p>

<p>If Thury’s law be considered, Thury also
held the ripeness of the ovum to be of importance
for male or female ova. The ova
were regarded by this author, as being more
or less ripe, or as male and female, according
to the time, whether it happened to be
at the beginning or at the end of the rutting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
To me, however, the ripeness seems
to depend upon the process of physiological
combustion in the organism of the mother.
According to Thury no attention need be
paid by us to the ripeness for fructification,
as this ripeness is attained independently of
our interference. But, on the other hand, our
influence has the effect of producing a male
ovum out of the ovule ready to be fructified.</p>

<p>If the dieting of a woman in the way we
recommend is practicable and of definite
effect upon the development of the future
sex, we arrive at a conclusion which may be
summed up as follows:—If a woman be
dieted according to our method, she can
reach a stage in which she becomes sexually
superior to the man, and her offspring will
then be male, in accordance with the law of
the cross-heredity of sex.</p>
